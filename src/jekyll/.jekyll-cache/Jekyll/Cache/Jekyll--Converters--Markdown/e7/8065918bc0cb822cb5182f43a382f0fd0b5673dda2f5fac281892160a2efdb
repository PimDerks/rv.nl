I"ó<p>What am I gonna do when I find that the dream is over<br />
What am I gonna do when I finally realize<br />
What am I gonna do when I there's nothing to hold on to<br />
What am I gonna do when I find out it's all a lie</p>

<p>Tell (I gotta know) me (I gotta know)<br />
Tell (I gotta know) me (I gotta know)<br />
Tell me that it's not a game</p>

<p>Here<br />
In this place of make-believe I slowly die<br />
Will you ever come clean<br />
Or would you like to see me living for a lie</p>

<p>What am I gonna do in this no-win situation<br />
What am I gonna do when there's nothing to decide<br />
How am I gonna live with this blind infatuation<br />
I bless the days I can leave it all behind</p>

<p>Tell (I gotta know) me (I gotta know)<br />
Tell (I gotta know) me (I gotta know)<br />
Tell me that it's not a game</p>

<p>Here<br />
In this place of make-believe I slowly die<br />
Will you ever come clean<br />
Or would you like to see me living for a lie</p>

<p>Nanananana-na-nanana-na-na-nanananana-na-na<br />
Nanananana-na-nanana-na-na-nanananana-na-na</p>

<p>Hey! - you know it's killing me<br />
Hey! - you know it's killing me<br />
Hey! Hey!<br />
Tell me it's not a game</p>

<p>Here<br />
In this place of make-believe I slowly die<br />
Will you ever come clean<br />
Or would you like to see me living for a lie</p>

<p>Will you ever get here<br />
In a rhapsody of angels we'll get high-high-high<br />
But I guess you'll never come clean<br />
Would you like to see me suffer till I die</p>
