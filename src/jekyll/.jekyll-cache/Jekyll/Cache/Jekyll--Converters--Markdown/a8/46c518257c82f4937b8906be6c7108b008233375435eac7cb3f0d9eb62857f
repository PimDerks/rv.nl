I"&<p>Prejudice reveals in all it's glory<br />
When you go outside you'll hear the marshmallow cry<br />
Just like you, the masses always bore me<br />
Try to make a difference but it's hard to get by<br />
How would you feel when you're all alone<br />
Out on your own and nowhere to belong</p>
