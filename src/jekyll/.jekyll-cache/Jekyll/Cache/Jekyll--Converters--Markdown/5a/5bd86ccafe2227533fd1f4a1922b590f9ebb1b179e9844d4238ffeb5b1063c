I"†<p>Hey Everyone !!</p>

<p>I locked myself up in the studio these past months and will be doing that the coming months as well to record the new album.
Meanwhile hereÂ´s a little X-mas gift for YOU, the fans &amp; followers - a Fleetwood Mac Cover I recently recorded: Go Your Own Way.
For now on behalf of me and the band: Merry Christmas &amp; Happy 2011!!</p>

<p>Yours,<br />
Robby</p>
