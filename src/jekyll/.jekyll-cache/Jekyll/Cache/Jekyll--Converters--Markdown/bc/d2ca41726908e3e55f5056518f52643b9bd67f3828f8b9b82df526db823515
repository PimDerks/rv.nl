I"0<p>In the land where my grandmother's now<br />
I wanna get there sometime<br />
There is the place I can break away<br />
from this painful masquerade<br />
But I have to be strong in life<br />
Just to earn my paradise<br />
Where I can finally say au-revoir<br />
To the pain of this aching heart</p>
