I"d<p>I closed another door<br />
Realized that I rode the wrong track<br />
It's too late to turn back... time<br />
I miss the times before - Lord what have I done<br />
Will I find you - Will I dare - Will you care</p>

<p>I can't live without you - Can't live without you<br />
Oooooooohhhhh what have I done</p>

<p>I'm sad forevermore</p>

<p>If I have to live life without you<br />
There's no one to turn to... Anymore<br />
Lord (tell me why) Tell me what's my cause<br />
Now that I have lost all I care for<br />
Will I find peace of mind - in this life</p>

<p>I can't live without you - Can't live without you<br />
Oooooooohhhhh</p>

<p>I (Lord will I) closed another door (every find joy in this life)<br />
Realized that I rode the wrong track (would I be lonesome for all time)<br />
It's too late to turn back... time<br />
Oh lord what have I done</p>
