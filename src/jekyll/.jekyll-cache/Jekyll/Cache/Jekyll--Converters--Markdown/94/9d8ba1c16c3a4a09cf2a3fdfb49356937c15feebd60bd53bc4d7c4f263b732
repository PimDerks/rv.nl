I"<p>I can't see through the darkness around me<br />
I can't breathe in the alternate world<br />
It's a death parade<br />
A leap of faith<br />
Colours to the blind<br />
Into the night<br />
Into the wild</p>

<p>I can't breath in the the hell that surrounds me<br />
I can't live in this substitute world<br />
It's a big mistake<br />
It's bend and break<br />
Turns you inside out<br />
Into the night<br />
Into the wild</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Black rain - black rain<br />
Black rain - is coming down<br />
Black rain - black rain<br />
Black rain - is falling down on me</p>

<p>It's too late for a new line of fashion<br />
Much too late for a new choice of fate<br />
Are you willing to die for a fatal conviction?<br />
Oooh the counterweight to the death parade<br />
Colours to the blind<br />
Into the night<br />
Into the wild</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus)</p>

<p class="em">(Solo)</p>

<p>I can't see through the darkness around me<br />
I can't breathe in the alternate world</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus x 2)</p>
