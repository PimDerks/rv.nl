I"Ã<p>Right after the battle of recording â€˜The Magic Infinityâ€™ I had a deadline to write and record a 45 minute rock-opera for an insurance companies-100 years anniversary. Though I desperately needed a rest to recharge, there just was no time for that. In â€˜overloadâ€™ I squeezed the opera out of me and once it was done I was completely empty. I wasnâ€™t able to write after that for more than 8 months. I felt totally blank for a long time.</p>
