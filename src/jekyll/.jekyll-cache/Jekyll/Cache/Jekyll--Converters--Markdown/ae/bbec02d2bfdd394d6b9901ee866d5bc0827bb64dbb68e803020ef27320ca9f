I"Ö<p>Life - when will it bring<br />
This memory back in time<br />
When will it bring me back<br />
The love of my life<br />
Can I ever solve<br />
The mystery in my heart<br />
Will I ever find out who you are<br />
Ooh I'm still trying</p>

<p>Love - will I always hold on<br />
To this love<br />
Even when the pain gets too tough<br />
No there's no one<br />
In the world like you<br />
No there's nothing<br />
I don't do for you - wooh<br />
Only for you - only for you</p>

<p>Wooh angel of my heart<br />
You don't know<br />
You still tear me apart<br />
Wooh angel of my heart<br />
I still love you</p>

<p>Time - never gave me any chance<br />
For peace of mind<br />
Never made me leave<br />
The heartache behind<br />
Now it's all so grey and blue<br />
Can't you see I'd die for you<br />
Wooh - only for you - only for you</p>

<p>Wooh angel of my heart<br />
You don't know<br />
You still tear me apart<br />
Wooh angel of my heart<br />
I still love you<br />
Oh I still love<br />
I'm still in love with you</p>

<p>Can't you see<br />
What she's doing to you<br />
Yeah - but my love still remains<br />
Wooh - don't you see<br />
Where it's leading you to<br />
But without her it is never the same<br />
Never be the same</p>

<p>Wooh angel of my heart<br />
You don't know<br />
You still tear me apart<br />
Wooh angel of my heart<br />
I still love you</p>

<p>Wooh - wooh - loving you<br />
I still believe in the things you do<br />
I'm still in love with you</p>
