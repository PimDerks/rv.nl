I"<p>They got me good, I got it bad<br />
I can't break down this wall inside my head<br />
They got me numb, they got me dumb<br />
Made me become some kind of walking dead</p>

<p>But I woke up, opened my eyes,<br /> 
Revealed their lies<br />
They serve the darkest forces <br />
The reptiles in disguise</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>We're the masters of our minds<br />
They're not taking over humankind<br />
When we open up our hearts and seek the good<br />
You'll find the truth</p>

<p>The system's dumbed me down a lot<br />
Poisoned vaccines they'd shot, they took me out<br />
The lies they planted in my head<br />
The news they spread made me too numb to doubt</p>

<p>But once you learn to understand their evil plan <br />
Don't fight fire with fire - be your own man</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>They use the MK-Ultra<br />
send a wolf in disguise<br />
And a Big Bad Brother to control your life <br />
Enslaving us: their goal<br />
But they'll never get my soul</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>
