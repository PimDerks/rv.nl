I"[<p>Wish I were in the little boys dream<br />
Where the soul is pure and the mind is green<br />
But the times have changed now I don't know where to go<br />
Love - gold - money<br />
I still dream of what I used to dream<br />
But the world today is a different scene<br />
But I just can't change so I think it's time to go<br />
Stop - No</p>
