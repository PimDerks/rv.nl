I"P<p>I have a dream and an endless desire<br />
Something stronger than love<br />
Still out of reach<br />
Please don't call me a liar<br />
Makes me feel I've had enough</p>

<p>Something inside is taking my mind away<br />
Something inside cuts my heart</p>

<p>Stroll so sad - rain in my face<br />
Need a shoulder to cry on<br />
Where's my girl for a light through this haze<br />
But she don't wanna see me anymore</p>

<p>Hard times in my life - they won't get me down<br />
But sometimes I don't know</p>

<p>From the blue sky heaven is callin'<br />
When I look into her eyes<br />
It's gotta be so nice<br />
From the blue sky heaven is callin' me now<br />
But here I gotta make it somehow</p>

<p>I still have a dream and an endless desire<br />
Keeps me from going insane<br />
But these days I'm hanging on a wire<br />
Ooh it feels so in vain</p>

<p>Well I try to lose my memories<br />
And start to live and tell<br />
But everytime it turns to be a madman's carrousel<br />
It's hard to understand those tears<br />
But I'm sure they're meant to be<br />
To fortify the winner in me</p>
