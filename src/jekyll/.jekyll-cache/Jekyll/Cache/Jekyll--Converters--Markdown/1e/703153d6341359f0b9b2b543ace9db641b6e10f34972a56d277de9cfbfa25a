I"è<p>Stay with me tonight <br />
Please don't go away <br />
I need you by my side<br />
They'll come for my life <br />
Don't let me close my eyes <br />
Keep me awake tonight</p>

<p>He knows the secrets that I keep<br />
Attacks me in my sleep and sucks me dry</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Oooooh - I'm running on empty<br />
The demons are haunting me, all through my life<br />
Oooooh - I'm running on empty<br />
The devil is after me, all dressed in white<br />
It comes down tonight</p>

<p>Stop this cruel decline<br />
Already lost one eye<br />
The other one half blind<br />
They crawl under your skin<br />
Slowly creeping in<br />
Until they finally win<br />
They know your weakest spot within<br />
Don't ever let 'em in - Just close your mind</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Oooooh - I'm running on empty<br />
The demons are haunting me - all through my life<br />
Oooooh - I'm running on empty<br />
The devil is after me, all dressed in white<br />
Stay by my side</p>

<p>My resistance's breaking - I got nowhere to go <br />
Can't you hear me banging on your door <br />
(Oh Father please) Let me in (let me in) Let me in<br />
Please fill me up once more</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Oooooh - I'm running on empty<br />
The demons are haunting me - all through my life<br />
Oooooh - I'm running on empty<br />
The devil is after me, all dressed in white<br />
It comes down tonight</p>
