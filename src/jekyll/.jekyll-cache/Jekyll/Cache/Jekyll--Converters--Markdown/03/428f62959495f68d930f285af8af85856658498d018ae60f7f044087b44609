I"Q<p>Prejudice reveals in all it's glory<br />
When you go outside you'll hear the marshmallow cry<br />
Just like you, the masses always bore me<br />
Try to make a difference but it's hard to get by<br />
How would you feel when you're all alone<br />
Out on your own and nowhere to belong</p>

<p>There's a rape going on down in broad daylight<br />
Everyone's on the streets messing with your mind<br />
Don't me mad, don't be sad<br />
Baby don't be a fool<br />
Being different is so cool</p>

<p>Racism is not a different story<br />
Yes it's my own choice, but must I kill myself inside?<br />
Turning heads and doors will close before me<br />
Thousand of rejections make it hard to get by<br />
Where would we be when we're all the same<br />
Nothing to lose no, and nothing to gain</p>

<p>There's a rape going on down in broad daylight<br />
Everyone's on the streets messing with your mind<br />
Don't me mad, don't be sad<br />
Baby don't be a fool<br />
Being different is so cool</p>

<p>Dreaming of awakenings in a different light<br />
Take me back to childhood, wash the sand out of my eyes<br />
Aaaaah, find a reason<br />
Take me to the river where the water makes you young and wise<br />
Give it to me, just a song for the world<br />
Give me a reason to live, to be heard<br />
But who will be there to see<br />
Who will be there to feel<br />
No one ever listen in this merry-go-round</p>

<p>There's a rape going on down in broad daylight<br />
Everyone's on the streets messing with your mind<br />
Don't me mad, don't be sad<br />
Baby don't be a fool<br />
Being different is so cool</p>
