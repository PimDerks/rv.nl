I"'<p>What do you say about my new addiction<br />
I watch the screen to see my life go by<br />
I found out my dream is just fiction<br />
to people in this phony world so why do I...</p>

<p>...worry about the creatures on this planet<br />
It's all just temporary not worthwhile<br />
What did I say? You know I didn't mean it<br />
I couldn't stand the feeling being on trial all the time</p>

<p>What would you do, what would you say<br />
how would you feel<br />
when the world has put you down to size<br />
Where would you go, what would you know<br />
who would you be at the end of the line</p>

<p>Well let me say my dream is not fiction<br />
I've seen the missionary man alive<br />
Sent by the Lord to give us all a vision<br />
But me too, I was weak, I was a fool for a while</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>What did you say you don't believe in fiction<br />
I'm telling you your life is so worthwhile<br />
So don't believe in all that false religion<br />
Just purify your soul and everything is alright</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>What would you do, what would you say<br />
how would you feel<br />
when the world has put you down to size<br />
Where would you go, what would you know<br />
who would you be at the end of the line<br />
at the end of the line<br />
at the end of the line</p>
