I"¢<p>Three little pieces put together. The end part is an attempt of a mid 70â€™s Brian May type of solo on vaudeville music that I had in my head for 10 years. As a huge fan I even played it on a copy of his guitar, though not through a Vox AC 30, but a Fender combo. With very tastefully played drums by Juan.</p>

<p>The middle partâ€™s a happy 60â€™s sounding thing, about a trip to England. And the first part a ballad about childhood memories. How my parents supported me, the music I grew up with, that became like a bible. Queenâ€™s â€˜A Night At The Operaâ€™ was the first album I got. A present for my 7th birthday from my grand mother. And I mention â€˜Every time I think of You â€˜ from the Babys, my first introduction to the beautiful voice of John Waite, since then Iâ€™m a huge fan . â€˜Mr. Blue Skyâ€™, My favourite ELO song. Those were the 3 most important bands for me when I grew up: Queen, ELO , The Babys.</p>
