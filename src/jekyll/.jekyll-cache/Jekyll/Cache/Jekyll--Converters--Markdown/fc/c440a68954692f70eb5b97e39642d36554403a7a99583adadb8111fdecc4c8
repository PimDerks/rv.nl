I"·<p>Musically the most easy going song of this CD. A bit Sgt. Pepper Beatle-minded. Lovely harmonies and chord progressing. An authentic composition brought into the new era.</p>

<p>Still lost in the maze of a heartbreak wanting to escape that miserable state of mind. Everything has changed just by following a dream that turned out wrong. Burned bridges, no return to whatâ€™s used to be, lost in an alternate world with no way out.</p>
