I"–<p>There is nothing more to say<br />
I got no more time to waste<br />
But there's nothing in my life<br />
that can forgive me my mistakes<br />
that can speed up my pace<br />
Like I'm dying deep inside</p>

<p>Why do I still live for the moment<br />
Why do I still fall into disgrace</p>

<p>Each and every night I pray<br />
Still my mind's in disarray<br />
I can't handle all these lies<br />
Too many times I was betrayed<br />
Ooh I can't live with all this hate<br />
It is ruining all my life</p>

<p>Why do I still fear for the future<br />
Why do I still live in yesterday</p>

<p>Break free - make a stand<br />
Reach for the sky - reach for the fire<br />
Don't fear - walk the stairs<br />
Into the the light - higher and higher<br />
It guides me - The Power Above</p>

<p>I got nothing more to say<br />
to my friends of yesterday<br />
to the burden in my mind</p>

<p>I won't vomit on their graves<br />
I'm sure that justice will prevail<br />
Here or in the future life</p>

<p>Why do I still feel all this anger<br />
Why do I still think of yesterday</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>The Power of Love<br />
The Power Above</p>
