I"Ò<p>Not a thing can turn you on
Out of reach youâ€™re a mastodon
Misfortune treats you like no other
Where are the goals youâ€™ve set in mind
Itâ€™s a farce for the color blind
No one can see it so why bother</p>

<p>Itâ€™s all about love - love - itâ€™s all about love
Itâ€™s all about love - love</p>

<p>Itâ€™s all about dope - and a Rolex on the wrist
of your hand on the wheel of a Benz
Itâ€™s all about sex itâ€™s the mainspring -
itâ€™s the thing that makes the world go round
Not the sound of the birds, not the waterfall,
sunset, rainbow, stop this train 
I wanna get off, Iâ€™ve had enough
donâ€™t you know that I gotta let go, let go, let go</p>

<p>So you wanted to be free from this life
And youâ€™re so determined to make it real this time
So you want to make it end
Let me tell you my friend
You should be glad youâ€™re alive</p>

<p>Why would I be so intoxicated by lonely eyes
Why donâ€™t I see without masquerade
And smile at the world
Oh why oh why oh why</p>
