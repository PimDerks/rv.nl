I"<p>Just a friend - It ain't easy to pretend<br />
Just a girl who crossed my path and changed my world<br />
Just a dream came into my life<br />
I couldn't close my eyes - God knows I tried</p>

<p>It was way too strong - I'm only human after all<br />
I had no choice<br />
No resistance to the voice that's telling me  you were sent to me<br />
It is destiny - But it cannot be</p>

<p>I cannot tell it to the world<br />
You don't know half how much it hurts<br />
But there's no choice to keep it to myself<br />
How could we stay in separate worlds when you're my angel send to earth<br />
It's killing me to keep it to myself<br />
But time will tell - Time will tell</p>

<p>Time stood still - We had no choice  we had no will<br />
The first embrace - The first time I touched your face<br />
I can't believe that we fit so well<br />
But it such a shame that we cannot tell<br />
Just a friend - It ain't easy to pretend<br />
Just a girl who crossed my path and changed my world<br />
You're a dream came into my life<br />
I could not deny - God knows I tried</p>

<p>I cannot tell it to the world<br />
You don't know half how much it hurts<br />
But there's no choice to keep it to myself<br />
When you're with me it feels so right<br />
It's such a shame we have to hide<br />
But then  you go and leave me in the night</p>

<p>How could we stay in separate worlds when you're my angel send to earth<br />
It's killing me to keep it to myself<br />
But time will tell - Time will tell<br />
You know it hurts torn apart in separate worlds</p>
