I"ì<p>I grew up with "A Night At The Opera"<br />
My mum and dad, they were the best<br />
"Mr. Blue Sky" and "Everytime I Think Of You"<br />
Those were the hits, my youth was blessed<br />
It was the key to a dream<br />
To show a world no one's ever seens<br />
The wonder years, if only they could last</p>

<p>1 o'clock I gotta go<br />
I gotta get down to the station<br />
Gonna see my babe this afternoon<br />
Cheerio, we gotta go to the great circus-show<br />
With Billy Blue and the tumbler too<br />
Fooling around</p>

<p>You and me - honeybee - on a trip over the ocean<br />
Went to see my dear old friend called Rupert<br />
Those were the days, we were ace<br />
But love wouldn't stay<br />
But no one takes these memories away</p>
