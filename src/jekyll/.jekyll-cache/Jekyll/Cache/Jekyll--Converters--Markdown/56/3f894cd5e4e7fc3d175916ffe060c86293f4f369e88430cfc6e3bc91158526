I"õ<p>Santa Zorra,<br />
Does one you married know who you are<br />
All this treason must have torn your in half<br />
Is it worth the price you pay... inside</p>

<p>Santa Zorra,<br />
Since you left me there's no life in my heart<br />
You're the reason I am falling apart<br />
It's my world you still control... mi san Zorra</p>

<p>Save my soul, break my faith no more<br />
Heal my broken world and guide me out of hell<br />
Save my soul, I can't take no more<br />
How my heart still hurts, it's under your spell</p>

<p>Santa Zorra,<br />
Are you happy with the one that you are<br />
Are you dreaming of (an) escape to the stars<br />
In this world we don't belong... mi san Zorra</p>

<p>Save my soul, break my faith no more<br />
Heal my broken world and guide me out of hell<br />
Save my soul, I can't take no more<br />
How my heart still hurts, it's under your spell</p>

<p>I'm standing before you - To tell you that I still adore you<br />
Hold the line - don't deny - anymore!</p>

<p>Chorus</p>
