I"¿<p>We used to love the silence<br />
We built a wall around us<br />
To play our solitary game<br />
The world of sacred magic<br />
Now looks like melted plastic<br />
All our pride turned into shame</p>

<p>The star that guides us<br />
Has surely lost it's way<br />
It makes us fight about<br />
Which words we want to say</p>

<p>Now there's only one thing<br />
For us to do<br />
Saying I love you<br />
Together we can make it through</p>
