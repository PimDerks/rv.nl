I"R<p>Wherever I go feel alone<br />
Wherever I do 'm on my own<br />
Like it should last forever and ever<br />
So many chances have gone by<br />
All by the cause of being too shy<br />
I don't wanna be lonely forever<br />
I'd like to go back all the way<br />
And do it right in every way<br />
I'm sure I would do whatever I'd like</p>
