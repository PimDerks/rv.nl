I"ê<p>An ode to Magnum ice cream. In the past I wrote some long and epical tracks . I was asked frequently to record more of these rock opera type of songs. Being fed up with recording long tracks and with that question I called this short song â€˜Magnum opusâ€™ . The title suggests a big rock opera or something like it, while itâ€™s just a silly 60â€™s type of song. It looks like itâ€™s about a girl but in the end it turns out to be about Magnum Ice-cream.</p>

<p>Maybe they can adopt it in a commercial . That would be a dream, full circle. It surely would be a little payback for all the money I spent on them through the years. I did some guitar harmonies with the Brian May guitar on it. And my favourite drummer Juan plays the drums.</p>
