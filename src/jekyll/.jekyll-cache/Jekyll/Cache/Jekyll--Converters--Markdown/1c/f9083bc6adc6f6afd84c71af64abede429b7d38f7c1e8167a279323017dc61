I"L<p>On the move on the prowl<br />
on the wings of an owl<br />
Life keeps on telling us lies<br />
Taught us to believe in a world<br />
that we should despise<br />
Where's the truth on the streets<br />
for the people in need<br />
Everyone's passing them by<br />
Fortunate ones only care<br />
for their own Christmas night</p>
