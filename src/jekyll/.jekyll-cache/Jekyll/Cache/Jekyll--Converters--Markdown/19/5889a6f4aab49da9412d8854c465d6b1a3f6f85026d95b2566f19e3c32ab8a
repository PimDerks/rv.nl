I"ø<p>Loaded with pressure on my own<br />
Locked in my door prancing so unknown</p>

<p>Here are my hopes<br />
Never recalled<br />
But life killed the mountain<br />
And no one stands tall</p>

<p>I believe in God<br />
I believe in love<br />
Never ask me why<br />
They don't really know, do you?<br />
Where the sacred son is going to</p>

<p>Tell me now<br />
Why you give me this feeling<br />
Or is life sold down the doubt</p>

<p>Tell me Lord<br />
what you do to me<br />
Why do you keep me alive?<br />
Do you hold me tight?<br />
I don't know why it's just a matter at all</p>

<p>I don't know how to please you <br />
I deceived you, I did try<br />
Can you ever trust me, Sire<br />
Can you ever trust me, Sire<br />
Never be the one in sin again</p>

<p>And that's a promise<br />
in my heart and in my soul<br />
And I will stay with you forever<br />
Through life, through eternity<br />
and back again<br />
You are the saviour of the universe<br />
You're the lord of of all, I believe in you</p>
