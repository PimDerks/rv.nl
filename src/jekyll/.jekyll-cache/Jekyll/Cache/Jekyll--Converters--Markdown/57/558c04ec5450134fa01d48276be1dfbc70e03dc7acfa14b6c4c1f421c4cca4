<p>One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
I'm doing allright!</p>

<p>Down to the situation like we've been before<br />
But now there's I difference babe I love you even more</p>

<p>N-nothing seems to matter now you're no longer mine<br />
Out of your head and out of your heart?<br />
No it doesn't take a genius to read between the lines<br />
She's out of my life</p>

<p>One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
I just can't deal with this life<br />
One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
Gotta fake my tormented mind, I'm doing allright!</p>

<p>Down to the rhythm of the deadbeat state of mind<br />
How could it linger on? We've got to change the tide</p>

<p>But all my dreams are shattered now you're no longer mine<br />
Out of my hair, but deep in my heart<br />
No it doesn't take a genius to read between the lines<br />
She's out of my life</p>

<p>One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
I just can't deal with this life<br />
One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
Gotta fake my tormented mind, I'm doing allright!</p>

<p>No it doesn't take a genius to read between the lines<br />
She's out of my life</p>

<p>One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
I just can't deal with this life<br />
One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
Gotta fake my tormented mind, I'm doing allright!</p>

<p>One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
I just can't deal with this life<br />
One of these days I'm gonna lose my mind<br />
Gotta fake my tormented mind, I'm doing allright!</p>
