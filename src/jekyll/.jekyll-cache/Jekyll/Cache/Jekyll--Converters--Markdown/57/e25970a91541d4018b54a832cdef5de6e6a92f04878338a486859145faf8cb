I"Ž<p>When I was a young boy,<br />
I didn't waste no time<br />
It all seemed so easy, I just lived my mind<br />
I did just what I had to do<br />
What I felt that was right</p>

<p>But then came the real world, I had to pay<br />
For being artless, for the way I behaved<br />
It made me weigh all my thoughts<br />
It taught me how to be uptight</p>

<p>But I just refuse to put up a fight<br />
With the one and only purity<br />
The kid in my eyes</p>

<p>Well I don't think twice<br />
I don't want to leave, leave him behind<br />
And I close my eyes<br />
'Cause I just can't live<br />
In a world made of lies</p>

<p>But there was a moment, I lost the faith<br />
Started to live by the rules they have made<br />
I was thinking all my life away<br />
Didn't know what was right</p>

<p>Life became so stupid, so senseless and grey<br />
Walking on a minefield<br />
Heading the wrong way<br />
Ooh everything I did felt wrong<br />
It was all a big mistake</p>

<p>So I made myself a promise in time<br />
I will never turn my back against<br />
The kid in my eyes</p>

<p>Well I don't think twice<br />
I don't want to leave, leave him behind<br />
And I close my eyes<br />
'Cause I just can't live<br />
In a world made of lies</p>

<p>(Interlude)</p>

<p>Well I don't think twice<br />
I don't want to leave, leave him behind<br />
And I close my eyes<br />
'Cause I just can't live<br />
In a world made of lies</p>

<p>Well I don't think twice<br />
I don't want to leave, leave him behind<br />
And I close my eyes<br />
'Cause I just can't live<br />
In a world made of lies, made of lies</p>

<p>Made of lies, made of lies<br />
Made of lies, made of lies</p>
