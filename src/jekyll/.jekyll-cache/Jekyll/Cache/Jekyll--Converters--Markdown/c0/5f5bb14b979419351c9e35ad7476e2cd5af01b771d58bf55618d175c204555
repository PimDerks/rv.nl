I"<p>This was the first song recorded for Bizarro World. It’s about all the trouble non-average people are going through. The black rain stands for all the bullying and name-calling, the teasing, the terror that us misfits have to go through. It’s about living in a world that’s not yours.</p>

<p>There’s no solution or uplifting message lyrically, but the sound and vibe of the chorus does. It’s like it actually says, no matter what they say, no matter what they made us go through, we are misfits, and we are proud of it. The more haters and narrow minded people are trying to make us feel bad, the stronger we get, the better we feel about ourselves. If the mud-throwing is a consequence of being true to yourself, than we are proud, proud of walking in the black rain.</p>
