I"€	<p>Shut down, broke down<br />
Bankrupt in the lockdown<br />
Up town, down town<br />
Walking into a ghost-town</p>

<p>Took away your life and theyâ€™re taking all your money</p>

<p>Head down, bow down, gotta keep your voice down<br />
Let down, cracked down, heading towards the meltdown<br />
Got to get away but we donâ€™t know where weâ€™re running to</p>

<p>We bring solutions several times every year<br /> 
Want to be free?<br /> 
Get your ass over here!</p>

<p>Roll up your sleeves slaves sleeves slaves<br />
Listen to Dr. Bill slaves<br />
He says, we say <br />
You want it to stop?<br /> 
You better roll up your sleeves slaves, sleeves slaves<br /> 
Better draw up your will, slaves</p>

<p>Ready or not , weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™ll be getting your shot!</p>

<p>Dumbed down, pushed around, everybody spellbound<br />
Stressed out, bummed out, anything for a way out<br />
Dying for the shot like bees do for honey</p>

<p>Big Jim, Big Jack, gotta get your minds back<br />
Build back better, yet...<br />
Nobody wants the reset<br />
Dare to disagree and you will turn into the enemy!</p>

<p>This big illusion keeps the people in fear<br />
You want your freedom?<br />
Get your ass over here</p>

<p>Roll up your sleeves slaves sleeves slaves<br />
Listen to Dr. Bill slaves<br />
He says, we say<br />
You want it to stop?<br />
You better roll up your sleeves slaves, sleeves slaves<br />
Better draw up your will, slaves</p>

<p>Ready or not , weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™ll be getting your shot!</p>

<p>Want it or not weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™ll be taking your shot!</p>

<p>Big wreck, pitch black,<br />
Half the worldâ€™s on Prozac<br />
Hijacked, side tracked,<br />
How do I get my life back</p>

<p>Roll up your sleeves slaves sleeves slaves<br />
Listen to Dr. Bill slaves<br />
He says, we say<br />
You want it to stop?<br />
You better roll up your sleeves slaves, sleeves slaves<br />
Better draw up your will, slaves</p>

<p>Ready or not weâ€™ll make sure you will roll up your<br />
Sleeves slaves sleeves slaves<br />
Listen to Dr. Bill slaves<br />
He says, we say<br />
If you want it to stop<br />
You better roll up your sleeves slaves sleeves slaves<br />
Better draw up your will slaves</p>

<p>Ready or not weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™ll be getting your...<br />
Ready or not weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™ll be getting your...<br />
Want it or not weâ€™ll make sure youâ€™ll be taking your shot!</p>
