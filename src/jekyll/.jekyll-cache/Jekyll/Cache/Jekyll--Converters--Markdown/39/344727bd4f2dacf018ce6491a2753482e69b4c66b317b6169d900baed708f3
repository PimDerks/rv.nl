I"4<p>I grew up with "A Night At The Opera"<br />
My mum and dad, they were the best<br />
"Mr. Blue Sky" and "Everytime I Think Of You"<br />
Those were the hits, my youth was blessed<br />
It was the key to a dream<br />
To show a world no one's ever seens<br />
The wonder years, if only they could last</p>
