I"<p>They say I'm crazy that I still got my faith in you<br />
Don't tell me "maybe"<br />
Now you've made me become unglued<br />
You keep me waiting<br />
While you're breaking my heart in two</p>

<p>Hey, Hey! Honey I would give my life for you<br />
Said you wanted me to marry you<br />
I gave you my world, a heaven on earth<br />
But you threw it all away<br />
So what's keeping you to say we're through</p>

<p>Don't, don't you fake me<br />
Now you made me too blind to see<br />
I must be crazy just to think we were meant to be<br />
Babe, I'm still waiting, masturbating on thoughts of you</p>

<p>Hey, Hey! Baby I would never lie to you<br />
Thought you wanted me to marry you<br />
I gave you my world, a heaven on earth<br />
You threw it all away<br />
But still you cannot say we're through</p>

<p>I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better! I should've known better! </p>

<p>Hey! Mean Master Race!</p>
