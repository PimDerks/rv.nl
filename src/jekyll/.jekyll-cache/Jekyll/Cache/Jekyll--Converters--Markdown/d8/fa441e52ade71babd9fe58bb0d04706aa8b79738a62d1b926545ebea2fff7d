I";<p>I wanted to become a star and see what has become of me<br />
A wife, a house, a shiny car, a chance to raise a family<br />
A mortgage until I die... could I wish any more?</p>

<p>But now she's gone away for good and I am on my own again<br />
An empty house, a painful truth: I hate to be my only friend<br />
A loner until I die? Did we have to divorce?</p>

<p>I have to keep on going but there's no one here to save me tonight</p>

<p>What in the world I'm waiting for<br />
What in the wayward world I'm waiting for<br />
What in the world I'm waiting<br />
What in the world I'm waiting for<br />
Waiting for</p>

<p>I hated to become a man but didn't want to be a girl<br />
I always do the best I can to be someone out of this world<br />
Pariah until I die? I can't take anymore</p>

<p>I wanted to be loved by you, not someone that you love to hate<br />
I don't want to deny the truth, I trust my sacramental fate<br />
A misfit until I die... I guess I don't have choice</p>

<p>I have to keep on going but there's no one here to save me tonight</p>

<p>What in the world I'm waiting for<br />
What in the wayward world I'm waiting for<br />
What in the world I'm waiting<br />
Wagoner Will is waiting<br />
What in thre wayward world he's waiting for</p>

<p>Why should someone sacrifice themselves<br />
When it destroys his life<br />
Then hands of evil score<br />
Stronger than before</p>

<p>What in the world I'm waiting for<br />
What in the wayward world I'm waiting for<br />
What in the world I'm waiting<br />
What in the world I'm waiting for<br />
Waiting for</p>
