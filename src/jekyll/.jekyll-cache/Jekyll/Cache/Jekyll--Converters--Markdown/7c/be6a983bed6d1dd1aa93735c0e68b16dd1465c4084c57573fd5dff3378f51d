I"ç<p>Was a stranger to myself<br />
I lost my grip but I could not tell<br />
I couldn't live for a love<br />
A love so unreal</p>

<p>An open door as the time will tell<br />
Won't ask for more - only make me well<br />
Just wanna live this dream<br />
So the wound can heal</p>

<p>Then all at once I had you on the line<br />
I hardly realised<br />
After a while we shared a feeling so fine<br />
I'll never forget that night</p>

<p>Angel - angel - see me down on my knees<br />
Beg my way through my tears<br />
Angel - angel - I love you</p>

<p>Feel so alone while you're far away<br />
I say a prayer - hope our love will stay<br />
Don't wanna lose you girl<br />
I need you right here</p>

<p>I close my eyes and I think of you<br />
Longing for you like I always do<br />
Oh how I miss you so<br />
Why can't you be near</p>

<p>Like in my dreams we held each other tight<br />
But now you're out of sight<br />
I never knew someone like you before<br />
I'll never forget that night</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Why do you still feel so unsure<br />
You just can't go on<br />
At night I lie awake<br />
But whatever it takes - I will wait</p>

<p>Angel - angel - see me down on my knees<br />
Beg my way through my tears<br />
Angel - angel - I want to be with you<br />
Nothing else I wanna do<br />
Angel - angel - see me down on my knees<br />
Babe I'm begging you please<br />
Angel - angel - I love you</p>
