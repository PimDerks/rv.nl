I"!<p>Comes to me, comforts me, rescues my world<br />
A shelter for each and everyone<br />
Truthfully, helpfully, too good for this world<br />
Like a safe haven in Babylon</p>

<p>Gives all the time<br />
Hears out the whine from all the people in need<br />
Silently, gracefully, mourning alone<br />
Hides all the tears for everyone</p>

<p>Painfully, secretly<br />
Nobody knows how much it takes to carry on<br />
Curelessly hurt, what is it worth living with no place to hide</p>

<p>Step by step, Everyday Hero gets through the life<br />
Step by step, Everyday Hero gets through the night<br />
Turns on the light for everyone</p>

<p>Come to me, rescue me, please say the words<br />
"I will be there for evermore"<br />
Open your heart to me, unlock you world<br />
Let me be there for evermore<br />
Look into my eyes, they're open wide<br />
I'm lost without you by my side</p>

<p>Step by step, Everyday Hero gets through the life<br />
Step by step, Everyday Hero gets through the night<br />
Turns on the light for everyone</p>

<p>Dadadam dadadam dadadam daada - lalalalaaah<br />
Dadadam dadadam dadadam daada - lalalalaaah<br />
Aaaah aaaah<br />
Step by step, Eveyday Hero - Step by step Everyday Hero<br />
Step by step, Everyday Hero - Turns on the light for everyone</p>

<p>Step by step, every day a hero comes to the world<br />
Step by step, every day a hero comes to the world<br />
Step by step, Everyday Hero came to the world<br />
Step by step, Everyday Hero gets through the night<br />
Turns on the light for everyone - For everyone</p>
