I"’<p>History have touched my heart again<br />
Yesterday will always beat tomorrow<br />
The world seemed such a better place back then<br />
Haunts me everywhere, haunts me everywhere</p>

<p>Television killed my soul again<br />
How on earth can I keep my faith in tomorrow<br />
Looks like all my dreams came to an end<br />
But you were anywhere, you were everywhere</p>

<p>I know it's time to face the future once again<br />
But here we are - standing on the edge</p>

<p>Yesterday is gone forever<br />
Live your life it's now or never<br />
Heroes will be born<br />
Yesterday is gone forever<br />
Live today it's now or never<br />
Here we must be strong<br />
We are not alone</p>

<p>The wonder years of childhood were the best<br />
But we just couldn't wait and see tomorrow<br />
How could we know life's journey's way too fast<br />
It waits for nobody, waits for no one</p>

<p>Yesterday is gone forever<br />
Live your life it's now or never<br />
Heroes will be born<br />
Yesterday is gone forever<br />
Live today it's now or never<br />
Here we must be strong<br />
We are not alone</p>

<p>I know it's time to face the future once again<br />
But here we are - standing on the edge</p>

<p>Yesterday is gone forever<br />
Live your life it's now or never<br />
Heroes will be born<br />
Yesterday is gone forever<br />
Live today it's now or never<br />
Here we must be strong<br />
We are not alone</p>
