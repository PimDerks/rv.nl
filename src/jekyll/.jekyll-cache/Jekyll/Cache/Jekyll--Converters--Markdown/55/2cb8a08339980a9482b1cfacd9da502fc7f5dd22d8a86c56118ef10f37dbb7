I"ƒ<p>Dear baby, we're both so unhappy now<br />
Being far apart, living in this cold world<br />
But darling, please believe me now<br />
To each other we belong - you're my only home<br />
Can't you see the world spins in a different way<br />
Since we fell into the dark - but we can<br />
find the magic back again - faith is all it takes<br />
Baby please awake, it's not too late</p>
