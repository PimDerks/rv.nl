I"‡<p>Looking for consolidation in the nighttime<br />
Trying to find an answer to the void<br />
Love is the best solution<br />
But love never finds its way to my door</p>

<p>Promised myself a new life from tomorrow<br />
Saving it every day for years and years<br />
But nothing is ever changing<br />
Nothing will ever be like before</p>

<p>It's just a test, that's what Lovey would say<br />
But I made a mess, it's the price I must pay<br />
For all the times I was going astray<br />
Throwing all the love away</p>

<p>Rock me like a hurricane<br />
Up the nose and through my veins<br />
White heat, white light<br />
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right</p>

<p>Rock me like a hurricane<br />
Addicted to love, I cast away<br />
Raw meat, read light<br />
I need a fix before the heat<br />
Comes down tonight<br />
Alright - yeah</p>

<p>Trying to come to grips with my desolation<br />
But how can I fill the void without a cure<br />
What is my destination?<br />
Guess there will never be a big reward</p>

<p>It's all a quest to a different day<br />
That's what she said<br />
Don't forget your prayers<br />
An apple a day keeps the doctor away<br />
But that won't ease the pain</p>

<p>Rock me like a hurricane<br />
Up the nose and through my veins<br />
White heat, white light<br />
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right</p>

<p>Rock me like a hurricane<br />
Addicted to love, I cast away<br />
Raw meat, read light<br />
I need a fix before the heat<br />
Comes down tonight<br />
Alright - yeah</p>

<p>It's just a test I'm about to fail<br />
I made a mess now it's time to pay<br />
For all the times I was going astray<br />
Throwing all the love away</p>

<p>Rock me like a hurricane<br />
Up the nose and through my veins<br />
White heat, white light<br />
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right</p>

<p>Rock me like a hurricane<br />
Addicted to love, I cast away<br />
Raw meat, read light<br />
It doesn't matter if it's wrong or right</p>

<p>Rock me like a hurricane<br />
Against the wall I go insane<br />
I need love, I need a life<br />
I need a fix before the heat comes down tonight<br />
Alright - alright - alright- - all night</p>
