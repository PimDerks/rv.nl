I"<p>Mickey was a cuty girl, witty and smart<br />
Peroxid hair, a butterfly heart<br />
We share the same sing, yeah that was a start<br />
Guess she was the first to tear me apart<br />
Here I go again, here I go again now<br />
Here I go again</p>

<p>Mickey was the first to mess with my mind<br />
Thought we were a pair but that was a lie<br />
She didn't have the heart to tell in the face<br />
In and out of love, back in my place<br />
Here I go again, here I go again now<br />
Here I go again, here I go</p>

<p>It was just a crush, probably not the real thing<br />
On that lonely road I often went astray<br />
It's a different story when you found the real thing<br />
And before your eyes it fades away</p>

<p>Please stop, don't go, don't leave me lonely<br />
Don't go, please stop, don't take your love away</p>

<p>Mickey was a cute girl, witty and fine<br />
Saw me on stage, dropped me a line<br />
I wrote back I had a girl but that was a lie<br />
Should've stuck to that, saved me a whine<br />
Here I go again, here I go again now<br />
Here I go again, here I go</p>

<p>Please stop, don't go, don't leave me lonely<br />
Don't go, please stop, don't take your love away</p>

<p>Please stop, don't go, don't leave me lonely<br />
Don't go, please stop, don't take your love away</p>
