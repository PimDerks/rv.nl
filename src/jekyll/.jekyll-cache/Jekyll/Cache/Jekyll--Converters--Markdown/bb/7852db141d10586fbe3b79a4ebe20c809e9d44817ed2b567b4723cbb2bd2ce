I"Æ<p>Love is made of words and scenery<br />
And passion's just a deal<br />
Cast a couple - could be you and me<br />
They tell you what you feel</p>

<p>And the earth goes round<br />
Still the answers can't be found<br />
And the silver screen is running around</p>

<p>I am searchin' since so long ago<br />
Time tells me no<br />
I keep holdin' on<br />
I've been waitin' for so many years<br />
Indifference and cheers<br />
How can I be wrong</p>

<p>Still I'm waiting every night and day<br />
And keep my peace of mind<br />
So sure I will find my way<br />
Or am I just too blind</p>

<p>And the earth goes round<br />
Still the answers can't be found<br />
And the silver screen is running around</p>
