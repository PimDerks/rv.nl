I"<<p>Destiny was calling from the sky (I'm falling, I'm falling)<br />
Showed me what a fool I've been to waste my life (and told me to retrieve)<br />
Nothing that I want is so impossible<br />
Everything I'm looking for is closer than it seems<br />
but it's invisible, magical, find it all before it's too late</p>
