I"f<p>HAPPY VALENTINES DAY Everyone !!!</p>

<p>Again we stick to the tradition of giving you fans something special on V-Day. This time its a yet unknown track that was initially written + recorded for ´THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PAIN´ back in summer 2002 but didnt make the Album in the end. Now, almost 8 years later &amp; exclusively on RV.com it finally sees the light of day!
For the occasion people celebrate today this song PAYBACK TIME might be quite a refreshing contrast as it represents more of the down- /darksides to Love + Romance…  so, in true (Robby) VALENTINE traditon ´expect the unexpected´ ;o)</p>
