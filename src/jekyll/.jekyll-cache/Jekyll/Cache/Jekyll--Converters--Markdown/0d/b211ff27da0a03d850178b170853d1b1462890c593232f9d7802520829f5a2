I"»<p>It's a cold and dark night for the soldiers<br />
They're a long way from home<br />
In a place where they're losing their youth<br />
In a war where they take no prisoners<br />
It's to live or be gone<br />
Now it is down to the truth</p>

<p>Left their lives behind, all the lovers, all the wives<br />
Goodbye to everything at home<br />
Will the ship return, will they come back alive<br />
Only the strong survive</p>

<p>Kombat, Kombat<br />
Look at the fear in their eyes<br />
Kombat, Kombat<br />
Surely they realize<br />
It's to live or die</p>

<p>It's a cold dark night for the youngsters<br />
Risking their lives<br />
Look at the courage they have<br />
Just scars they get from the army<br />
No glittering prize<br />
What kind of future they have</p>

<p>Left their dreams behind for somebody else's strife<br />
Goodbye to innocence and youth<br />
Will the ship return, will they come back alive<br />
Only the strong survive</p>
