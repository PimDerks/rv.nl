I"p<p>I had a lot of time in between the recording and release of the first album , which I spent with writing almost all of the songs for the next.
The Magic Infinity became more like a band album than any other. Rob Winter (guitar), Arthur Polini (Bass) and myself were very close at the time of recording. John Ewbank, our keyboard player on stage who was still in the band, didnâ€™t play on the album, we needed him live.
Arthur came up with the title.
Though Hans Eijkenaar left the band before, he still played on the album.
Again it was done at the Wisseloord studios, this time with John Sonneveld and Pim Koopman.</p>
