I"<p>Sitting on my bedside<br />
It's another long and restless night<br />
Stronger than ever<br />
How I need your touch, to hold you so tight<br />
The way I feel it must be real<br />
You're like the air that I breath<br />
Like the nightmares I have coming true - without you</p>

<p>Take me home, my love<br />
To you, my love<br />
Just because we're far apart doesn't mean<br />
we are through</p>

<p>Take me home, my love<br />
To you, my love<br />
I ask you on my knees, just take me home</p>

<p>Still remember last year<br />
I was such a fool to let you go<br />
The torment's forever<br />
It's my worst mistake to hurt you so<br />
The pain in me it feels so real<br />
It's like I'm losing myself<br />
Like a rebel who can't find a clue - without you</p>

<p>Take me home, my love<br />
To you, my love<br />
Just because we're far apart doesn't mean<br />
we are through</p>

<p>Take me home, my love<br />
To you, my love<br />
I ask you on my knees, just take me home</p>

<p>Why was I so selfish and untrue<br />
How can I see, how can I feel - without you</p>

<p>Take me home, my love<br />
To you, my love<br />
Just because we're far apart doesn't mean<br />
we are through</p>

<p>Take me home, my love<br />
To you, my love<br />
I ask you on my knees, just take me home</p>
