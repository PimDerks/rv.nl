I"<p>If you're one of the folks who try to change the world a bit<br />
but the things you do they run counter to it<br />
no blame, don't be ashamed afterall<br />
that's what we've been told</p>

<p>Under the willow<br />
Everyone tell your child<br />
Under the willow<br />
Tell how they must live their lives</p>

<p>Oh save our souls (come up and save our souls)<br />
Let me show you the road (we will show you the road)</p>

<p>A blue pre-historic Monday<br />
How gifted they were<br />
How we've unlearned it all<br />
Returning the gift one day</p>

<p>Imagine an Earth where the Common Flag waves<br />
Would be a wealthy world if we did it right<br />
When you realize the wealth of mind &amp; life<br />
We'd be the Kings in a new paradise</p>

<p>Under the willow<br />
Everyone tell your child<br />
Under the willow</p>

<p>Everyone knows<br />
the way it all goes<br />
now, same the world<br />
stop WWW3 commencing in 1999</p>

<p>Lift this world to higher ground with mindcraft &amp; devotion</p>

<p>Tell it to the future child</p>
