I"Ã<p>I almost sank into the water<br />
I saw my sanity go by<br />
Voices from the skies above united us in time<br />
the supernatural sign</p>

<p>I just wanna save the world<br />
I'm not a saint and that's alright<br />
I just want it to unfurl<br />
its kindness and its open mind</p>

<p>All you disciples come on follow me<br />
Open the skies for those who lie and deceive<br />
Make them dig deep inside<br />
To the love they might hide</p>

<p>On my way to save the world<br />
I'm banned and turned upside down<br />
They keep trying to unfurl<br />
The evil I had killed inside</p>

<p>All Pharisees you don't know what you do<br />
Just clear the way because you don't have a clue<br />
How can I make this right<br />
I will stay black and white</p>

<p>You can run and hide<br />
You can call me blind<br />
But there soon will come a time<br />
You will see who's right<br />
Then you wish you'd find<br />
The supernatural sign</p>

<p>I don't wanna save the world<br />
I'm infected with their lies (like it's contagious)<br />
Now I gotta blame the girl<br />
For keeping me awake at night</p>

<p>Lord of disciples come on and rescue me<br />
I'm so alone and I miss all my dreams<br />
I sure dig deep inside to the love that I hide</p>

<p>Or is this all to find myself in me<br />
Or is there more that I could never see<br />
There was a reason for this insanity<br />
'Cause now I know the truth behind the stranger in me</p>

<p>I just wanna save the world<br />
I'm not a saint and that alright<br />
I just want it to unfurl<br />
Its kindness and its open mind</p>

<p>All you disciples come on follow me<br />
Open the skies for those who lie and deceive<br />
I sure dig deep inside<br />
And I stay black and white</p>

<p>You can run and hide<br />
You can run and hide<br />
But there soon will come a time<br />
That you'll see who's right<br />
Then you wish you'd find<br />
The supernatural sign</p>

<p>That's why I choose a supernatural time</p>
