I"∫<p>The first song I wrote meant for this album was ‚ÄúTHE WAY TO EUPHORICA‚Äù.
Wrote it on the night of June 15, 2002. That day was the day of my father‚Äôs death 5 years before. I let a tape recorder running while playing the piano and lit a candle. Maybe he could help me. I definitely wanted the new album to become a heavy one.(I find it easier to find guitar riffs on the piano).
But after playing for hours nothing good came to me.</p>
