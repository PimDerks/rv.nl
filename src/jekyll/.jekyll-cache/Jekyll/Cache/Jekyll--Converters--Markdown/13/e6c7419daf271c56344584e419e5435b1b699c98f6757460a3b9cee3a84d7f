I"”<p>This is one of the pop-metal songs of the album. Like â€˜New Worldâ€™. A bit of nu-metal combined with clear harmonies/melodies and song structure. For months and months I was waiting for my girl to come back to me. We were, as I thought, temporary separated. Living 2000 km apart.</p>

<p>As a result of this waiting I hardly worked or wrote anything. It felt my life was on hold and would start again once she would return. At one point I realized she didnâ€™t have the intention to come back to me after all.</p>

<p>Big desperation and knowing deep down inside that it was over made me start recording and writing again. It was the only way for me to get through, to put my emotions into songs, as a safe haven to deal with the pain of losing her and to deal with the fading hope. Making music was the only way not to go insane completely. In this song I can hear I still have hope, but being very upset.</p>
