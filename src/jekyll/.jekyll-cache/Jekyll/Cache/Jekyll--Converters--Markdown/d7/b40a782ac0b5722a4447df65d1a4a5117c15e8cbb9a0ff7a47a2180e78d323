I"<p>Just a man made a stand for humanity<br />
He came as a friend<br />
But misfits felt betrayed</p>

<p>They took his life instead<br />
But no one could take the beautiful dream he had</p>

<p>The forces of God - The power of secrecy<br />
The forces of God - Control our destiny<br />
The forces of God</p>

<p>Just a child in heart and mind<br />
Wrote a symphony<br />
But in the end<br />
Some evil killed his ways</p>

<p>Too soon he had to go<br />
But nothing could kill the beautiful songs he wrote</p>
