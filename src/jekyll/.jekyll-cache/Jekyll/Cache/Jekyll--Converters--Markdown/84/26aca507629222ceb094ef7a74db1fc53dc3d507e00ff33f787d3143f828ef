I"7<p>There is a girl<br />
She has a cancer<br />
She's only sixteen years old<br />
Within this world she lost all her chances<br />
With only a few months to go</p>

<p>It's so unfair why life has to leave her<br />
God knows what she's going through<br />
She knows she dies<br />
But nothing can break her to make all her wishes come true</p>

<p>She gives life in a short time a meaning<br />
And does everything she wants to do</p>

<p>Never too late to live<br />
When the future is gone you see life as a gift<br />
Never too late to live<br />
No it's never too late, to live your life</p>

<p>There was a girl<br />
She died of cancer<br />
It happened like she always knew<br />
Within this world she took all her chances<br />
And made all her wishes come true</p>

<p>She gives life in a short time a meaning<br />
And did everything she wanted to do</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>When luck's running out, or love gets you down<br />
Don't make a mess of your life<br />
Just keep on believing in all of your dreams<br />
Think they will all come true</p>

<p>Chorus x 2</p>
