I"»<p>Piano rock-ballad. Expressing my big desperation about losing the one I loved. I remember recording this track as a quick demo, with a drum-machine, for the drummer to rehearse . When I wanted to record the vocal on the final recording again, it couldnâ€™t be done. It was just too painful to reproduce the â€˜painâ€™ I captured on the quick vocal-take recorded for the demo that had the intention I wanted. So I used that vocal-track.</p>
