I"§<p>Baby it's late, I'm so down and out<br />
Drown myself over you<br />
The longer I wait, the more I doubt<br />
Was it just a phase that we went through<br />
On the wings of love we flew a record-high<br />
Can't believe it was meant to pass by<br />
No I can't stop loving you<br />
Nothing helps, no matter how I try<br />
Torn, being ignored, babe it froze me to the core<br />
But still it's you I'm living for</p>
