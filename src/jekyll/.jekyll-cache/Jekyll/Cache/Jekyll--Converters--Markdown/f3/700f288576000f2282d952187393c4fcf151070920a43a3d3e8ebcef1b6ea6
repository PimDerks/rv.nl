I"Í<p>(Robby) Valentineâ€™s 8th studio album â€˜Falling Down In Misanthropolisâ€™ gives an honest inside look into the personal turmoil of the mind of itâ€™s creator during the time of recording and writing of it.
â€˜Misanthropolisâ€™, the name of Valentineâ€™s studio and residence , a combination of the words misanthrope and Metropolis.</p>

<p>The story of Michael DouglasÂ´ starring movie â€˜Falling Downâ€™ was taken as a metaphor for the lyrical content of this album and included in the album title.</p>

<p>Every instrument on this CD is played by RV, as well is the production.
Apart from two cover versions (Abbaâ€™s SOS and Queenâ€™s Flick Of The Wrist) all songs are originally written by RV.</p>

<p>This album is the darkest in Robbyâ€™s now 8th album counting oeuvre .
Heavier, more brutal sound and lyric wise. Emotional . Down to earth., but still with his familiar angelic choirs and his characteristic clear sounding voice.
Clever production and arrangements all done in â€œMisanthropolisâ€ his personal recording studio.</p>

<p>This time not so many pianoâ€™s appear. Mainly it became a guitar oriented album that suited the attitude of the powerful compositions best.
Valentine sounds heavier than ever.</p>
