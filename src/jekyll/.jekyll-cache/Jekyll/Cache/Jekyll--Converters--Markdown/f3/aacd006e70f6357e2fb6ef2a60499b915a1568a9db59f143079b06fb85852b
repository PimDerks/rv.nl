I"<p>I looked in the mirror<br />
I was so far from home<br />
It was the life I always wanted<br />
Never felt so alone</p>

<p>I asked myself<br />
must I go through this hell again<br />
I was tired of beinig lonely<br />
I was lost without a friend</p>

<p>But all it took was a miracle<br />
'Cause all my life I've been waiting for you</p>

<p>But now that your spirit glows inside of me<br />
I can finally feel like heaven<br />
You're more than I wanted, we are meant to be<br />
You exceed my dreams, you're heaven<br />
You're all my mind can see - Ma cherie</p>

<p>Back to my senses<br />
At this place all alone<br />
She's the love I always wanted<br />
Like I finally found home</p>

<p>I told myself I mustn't lose my head again<br />
I was tired of all the hurting and the pains that never ends<br />
But we just knew that it was magical<br />
'Cause all my life I've been searching for you</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Take my hand and let our lives begin<br />
Take me all the way, carry me home</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
