I"G<p>Deadbeat boy, did you buy a new toy<br />
    No way you're replacing me<br />
    Ain't gonna give it up, ain't gonna giddy up and go go, no no<br />
    Don't get coy, I will suck all the joy<br />
    Out of all of your crazy dreams<br />
    Dare me to shiver 'em, better be quivering<br />
    Back down, back down</p>
