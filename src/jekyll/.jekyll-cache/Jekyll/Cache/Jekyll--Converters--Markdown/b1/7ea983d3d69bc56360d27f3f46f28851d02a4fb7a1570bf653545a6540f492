I"=<p>Just a dream<br />
But it took me far away from here<br />
A tide of tears<br />
Just a year - wasted on the one so insincere<br />
So severe</p>

<p>Now's a different day - washing the tears away<br />
Left me in disarray<br />
So how can I survive this place</p>

<p>Someone stole the sun and took it out of here<br />
Someone sold the world, just get me out of here<br />
Takin' it all away</p>

<p>Just a bird...<br />
But she crushed the very heart in me<br />
Depravity<br />
Not a word, not an answer, no apology<br />
A mystery</p>

<p>Now's a different day - washing the shadows away<br />
All that she could not say<br />
What would it matter now today</p>

<p>Someone stole the sun and took it out of here<br />
Someone sold the world, just get me out of here<br />
Takin' it all away</p>

<p>Guess it was all a fantasy<br />
Should have known better it never comes for free</p>

<p>Now's a different day - wishing the memory away<br />
Left me in disarray, but does it matter now today</p>

<p>Someone stole the sun and took it out of here<br />
Someone sold the world, just get me out of here<br />
Takin' it all away</p>

<p>Someone stole the sun and took it out of here<br />
Someone sold the world, just get me out of here<br />
Takin' it all away</p>

<p>Just a dream<br />
But it took me far away from here... Aaah.</p>
