I"Û<p>A slow, heavy-beat instrumental based on a metal guitar rif. Nop Ton plays a killer drum-track recorded in Fendal. It sounds like an exodus of elephants. Trying to say with this: habits die hard in the mind of an elephant. The creature with the biggest memory and a slow pace . The â€˜exodusâ€™ of moving on in life doesnâ€™t happen over night. Gone is the new positive attitude like in the song before. Back in the rain again that leads into the next solitary track.</p>
