I"^<p>I don't know, I don't care<br />
what's goin on<br />
In the world of the wolves<br />
I don't belong<br />
People say I'm out of my mind<br />
They're just mentally blind</p>

<p>Every street, every town<br />
It's all the same<br />
It's the black, it's the white<br />
who get the blame<br />
Searching for an open mind<br />
For the innocent kind<br />
But I just can't find</p>

<p>All I ever do is search for the truth<br />
Wander day and night<br />
Please give me a clue<br />
Looking for a heartbeat pounding so true<br />
I'm counting on You my Lord<br />
Don't tell me there'll be less to find</p>

<p>I don't know, I don't care<br />
what's going on<br />
In a world of despair<br />
I don't belong<br />
People lose the way to their hearts<br />
for the immortal farce<br />
(so many dumb souls living a lie)</p>

<p>I don't feel for a mind<br />
where love is gone (I hate it, I loathe it)<br />
Should I care for the souls<br />
in which right is wrong<br />
Got to get it out of my mind<br />
before it intertwines<br />
with the child inside</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
