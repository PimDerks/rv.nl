I"><p>There's a little star so bright<br />
Comes into the heart of each child<br />
And shows the one truth ever tells<br />
The one clue in this carousel<br />
Failed by the storm outside<br />
Grew up in a world full of strict religious laws<br />
To fight for the land<br />
Their one truth leads to the very end</p>
