I"ä<p>Through the eyes of a child<br />
I was gazing at this life<br />
And what did I see hate towards disparity<br />
Couldn't believe my eyes<br />
How could they be so unwise<br />
Is it all jealousy or just dumb stupidity</p>

<p>Everybody can't you see<br />
We should live in peace and harmony<br />
To achieve supremacy<br />
Why don't you believe it, feel it</p>

<p>Black and white united<br />
This is all we're waiting for<br />
Black and white united<br />
It's in you, it's in me</p>

<p>When I looked back in time<br />
In the books of history<br />
War was all I could see<br />
Nothing we've learned so it seems</p>

<p>Tell me, is there a cure<br />
For this global disease<br />
Why are we so ill at ease<br />
Help us Father, if you please</p>

<p>Everybody don't you see<br />
How we put this world in jeopardy<br />
Love will lead to victory<br />
You have to believe it, feel it</p>

<p>Black and white united<br />
This is all we're waiting for<br />
Black and white united<br />
It's in you, it's in me</p>

<p>All your hate and all your fears<br />
All your pain will disappear<br />
You just have to be sincere<br />
Keep the faith and keep your dreams<br />
Don't you lose your self-esteem<br />
That's the way to go up-stream</p>

<p>Black and white united<br />
This is all we're waiting for<br />
Black and white united<br />
It's in you, it's in me</p>

<p>Black and white united<br />
This is all we're waiting for<br />
Black and white united<br />
It's in you, it's in me</p>
