I"“<p>Just piano and vocal . I had the grand-piano tuned for recording most of the pianoâ€™s on the album. Once that was done I kept on playing through the night because the sound of the piano, all miked-up, through the headphones , was very inspiring.</p>

<p>Instantly I wrote this song and recorded it. Captured the atmosphere at the moment the song was as close within me as possible. I wanted this to be a hidden track but mentioned it on the track-list after all, because I donâ€™t want it to be missed.</p>

<p>The quickest song Iâ€™ve ever written and the first I recorded right after writing it. Itâ€™s actually one of my favourites on this record.</p>
