I"ó<p>Sleep tight - white lie - no last goodbye<br />
What's it all to you<br />
Fogged, fried, uptight - no why<br />
Murdered inside</p>

<p>Can't breathe! Getting too deep!<br />
No sleep! Forever I bleed!<br />
Don't you see that I will die for you</p>

<p>All fucked up and no place to go<br />
Giving up hope, became a two way loser<br />
Gone my world, just for a girl<br />
Forever alone, why did I have to lose her</p>

<p>No escape I'm falling down<br />
No escape I'm falling down</p>

<p>Black hole - trapped soul<br />
Lost all control - all because of you<br />
No pride - I can't hide<br />
Denied, but still on your side<br />
Lost my heart with you</p>

<p>All wrong! Coming undone!<br />
Black rain! Going insane!<br />
No more! I give it all up to you</p>

<p>All fucked up and no place to go<br />
Giving up hope, became a two way loser<br />
Gone my world, just for a girl<br />
Forever alone, why did I have to lose her</p>

<p>No escape I'm falling down<br />
No escape I'm falling down</p>
