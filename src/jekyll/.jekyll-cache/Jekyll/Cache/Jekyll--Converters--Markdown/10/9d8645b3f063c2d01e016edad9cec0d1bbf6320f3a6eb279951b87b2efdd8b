I"D<p>Oohoo ooh - I know it's true<br />
It's wrong to live in solitude<br />
Oohoo ooh - so sad and true<br />
They try to tear my soul in two</p>

<p>I'm at the border of my heart<br />
Oh it's pushing me so far<br />
and it's taking all the vital strength away</p>

<p>Oohoo ooh - believe it's true<br />
I'd rather die in solitude...</p>

<p>They keep trying<br />
Classifying<br />
They keep lying<br />
Crucifying<br />
They keep smiling<br />
I'm defying - on and on and on and on</p>

<p>'Cause action speaks louder than words<br />
My voice keeps on calling, but it seems so unheard<br />
I crawl and I cry, in search for a why<br />
Why am I here in this world<br />
I'm just a Martian on Earth</p>

<p>I remember the time<br />
When I was fightin' for the dreams I'd set in my mind<br />
I woke up and I found<br />
That no one ever cares about my feelings inside</p>

<p>Is this all I'm living for<br />
Is this all there is<br />
There must be more to life than fighting for a cause</p>

<p>Can't you see me going under<br />
In a world of rain and thunder<br />
In a life where business creatures<br />
Got the role of music preachers</p>

<p>This is more than fiction, it's true<br />
I'm the dawn into something new<br />
Living songs, what more can I do<br />
I fall and I fight, don't understand why<br />
They try to kill me inside</p>

<p>I took it all for granted when I was a little boy<br />
I had a dream, a call, a goal, it's still my only joy<br />
This vision so strong, so right<br />
It's wrong in their eyes<br />
The spirit of gold controls their minds:<br />
"For a million eyes a lie"</p>

<p>Tycoon terror now<br />
Tycoon terror now<br />
Tycoon terror now</p>

<p>Boy, you've chose a life where we decide<br />
What to do, who you are, so lose your pride<br />
Give it up - tycoon<br />
Give it up - terror</p>

<p>No, I'd rather be poor<br />
Than feeling like a whore<br />
I'd rather be unknown<br />
I'd rather sing in solitude<br />
Then become a musical prostitute</p>

<p>We go back to 1968<br />
A slimy little creep slipped through the gate<br />
His folks so glad with the child they had<br />
But didn't know they would regret</p>

<p>Nightmare began with the black and white<br />
Rockin' the house all day and night<br />
W-w-w-atching young Merc on the tv-screen<br />
Giving little Robby his magic dream</p>

<p>Woo - yeah<br />
Woo<br />
Sweet 17 he quits from scrool<br />
Everybody said: "What a stupid fool!"<br />
But a little voice between his ears<br />
said: "Ready and go the course is clear!"</p>

<p>On my way to the stars<br />
Thought it couldn't be far<br />
Now I'm lost in the dark</p>

<p>Get me out of this marsh<br />
Get me high in the chart<br />
Before time shows it's marks</p>

<p>Woo - yeah<br />
Woo - yeah<br />
Woo - yeah<br />
Woo - yeah</p>

<p>I was 21 when the deal was signed<br />
It all went well for a long long time<br />
Everybody liked my "super" song<br />
Until they saw my style it all went wrong</p>

<p>How dare you "V" to be like this<br />
In a narrow minded world full of prejudice<br />
ssssspitten in the face: "What a waste of birth"<br />
it really made me feel like a Martian on Earth</p>

<p>On my way to the stars<br />
Thought it couldn't be far<br />
Now I'm lost in the dark</p>

<p>Get me out of this marsh<br />
Get me high in the chart<br />
Before time shows it's marks</p>

<p>The world is there for me to open up my eyes<br />
But I refuse to see the hate and wicked lies<br />
It made me dancing in the vale of tears I cried<br />
I'm still trying</p>

<p>From emotion<br />
to devotion<br />
To the dreams in my mind<br />
Let me be<br />
Ooh-wicked world - set me free</p>

<p>Can't you see me going under<br />
In a world of rain and thunder<br />
Very soon we hit the ground<br />
Pretty soon we're going under<br />
No I'll never tell a lie because I know... I'm right</p>

<p>I'm walking through the ocean in the middle of the night<br />
I'm sinking in emotion - But I'm too proud for suicide<br />
I want to face the day when everything gets right<br />
I'd like to live and play on stages oversized<br />
I will be there when the world has opened it's eyes<br />
Save us dear God from conservative lies</p>

<p>Don't be lie - your feelings inside<br />
But life can go on by with a wink of an eye<br />
Please don't cry - I'm sure you will find<br />
Is it worth this self sacrifice<br />
It's gonna get you to Paradise</p>

<p>'Cause action speaks louder than words<br />
My voice keeps on calling, but it seems so unheard<br />
I crawl and I cry, in search for a why<br />
Why am I here - why am I here?</p>

<p>'Cause action speaks louder than words<br />
My voice keeps on calling, but it seems so unheard<br />
I crawl and I cry, in search for a why<br />
Why am I here in this world<br />
I'm just a Martian on Earth</p>

<p>Wondering why - living to die</p>

<p>I'm just a messenger... in this world</p>
