I"–<p>August 28, 1990 was the big day for me. The start of recording the first album , in Wisseloord . I was 21 , for the first time as a solo artist in the big studio. Though I had great moral support from my friend and bass player Arthur Polini , who was already with me since â€™89 and played bass and did harmony vocals on a couple of tracks. But most of the instruments I played myself on the album.</p>
