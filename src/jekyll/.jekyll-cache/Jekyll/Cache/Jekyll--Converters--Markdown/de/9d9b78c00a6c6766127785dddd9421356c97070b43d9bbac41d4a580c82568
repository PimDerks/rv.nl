I"²<p>She screams like a new-born child<br />
if she can't get what she likes<br />
She changes at full moonlight<br />
into a heck of a dyke</p>

<p>I'm not sure she's wrong or right<br />
but she makes me fell alright!</p>

<p>Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again?!)<br />
Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again - on me)</p>

<p>She's just like a butterfly<br />
Always in love for a while<br />
She'll change almost every night<br />
never be anyone's bride</p>

<p>I'm not sure she's wrong or right<br />
but she makes me fell alright!</p>

<p>Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again?!)<br />
Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again - on me)</p>

<p>Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again?!)
Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again - on me)</p>

<p>Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again?!)<br />
Lion, no you never gonna live this way (come again - on me)</p>
