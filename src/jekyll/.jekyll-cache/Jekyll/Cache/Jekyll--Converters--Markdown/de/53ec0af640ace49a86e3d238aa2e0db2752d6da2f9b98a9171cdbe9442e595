I" <p>This won't last for always - and forever<br />
We will be together soon - we share one heart<br />
We are forever - yes, we are</p>

<p>This world hurts as always<br />
But it never can deceive our destined love<br />
Desperate hearts<br />
Made for each other - yes, we are</p>

<p>We walk the storm to find our home<br />
We will be strong, holding on<br />
'Cause soon we will be one</p>

<p>Distance separates us - find an answer<br />
How to see this nightmare through<br />
Without you, my love - nothing's to matter<br />
Life's so tough</p>

<p>This won't last for always - and forever<br />
We will be together soon - we share one heart<br />
We are forever - yes, we are</p>

<p>We walk the storm to find our home<br />
We will be strong, holding on<br />
'Cause soon we will be one</p>
