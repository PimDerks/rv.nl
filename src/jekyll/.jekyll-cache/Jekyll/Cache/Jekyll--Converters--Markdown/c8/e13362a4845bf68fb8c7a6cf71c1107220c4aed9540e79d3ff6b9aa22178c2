I"Ç<p>No one knows what the 21st century might bring<br />
Rays of hope or disaster our future gets it</p>

<p>But no one can see what's ahead in this life<br />
Unite all our forces and reach for the light<br />
Synchronize our hearts</p>

<p>Let's give this world a new tomorrow<br />
Let's make it brighter every day, only the good in us must follow<br />
Together we'll win, let the dream begin</p>

<p>No one dares to believe in the power of dreams<br />
Faith will die when the need for security wins</p>

<p>But no one can foresee, the course of your life<br />
No fortune-book story, it's you who decides<br />
Listen to your heart</p>

<p>Let's give this world a new tomorrow<br />
Let's make it brighter every day, only the good in us must follow<br />
Together we'll win, let the dream begin</p>

<p>Let's give this world a new tomorrow<br />
Let's make it brighter every day, only the good in us must follow<br />
Together we'll win, let the dream begin</p>
