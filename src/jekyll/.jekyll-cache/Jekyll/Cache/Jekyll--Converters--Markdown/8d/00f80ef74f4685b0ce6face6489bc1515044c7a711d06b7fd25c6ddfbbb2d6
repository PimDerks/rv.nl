I"ñ<p>My Brian May version to the theme from the â€˜Back To The Futureâ€™ movie. Itâ€™s one of my all time favourite movies. Think I will use it as a show opener. It sounds like pure Victory. Such a brilliant composition of Alan Silvestri.</p>

<p>Coming from â€˜One Heartâ€™ itâ€™s great as an intro for the next song â€˜Now Or Neverâ€™. Also the meaning. The whole album Iâ€™ve been mourning and moaning about losing my girl. And now itâ€™s time to get back to the future. Get on with life.â€</p>
