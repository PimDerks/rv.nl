I"ç<p>I believed in love<br />
Love at first sight<br />
I gave my heart to someone<br />
Whose love was a lie<br />
I took up with those<br />
Who caused me misery<br />
They only wanted money<br />
Didn't care about me</p>

<p>That's life<br />
But I close the evil doors<br />
That's life<br />
No I won't fall anymore<br />
That's life<br />
I finally feel the power in me</p>

<p>When there's no turning back<br />
To the one I was before<br />
And there's no turning back<br />
'Cause I'm going for more<br />
This time I don't reach for nowhere<br />
'Cause He gave me the sign<br />
On my way to the time<br />
Where my heart is high</p>

<p>I did everything<br />
For all the friends I had<br />
But when they didn't need me<br />
I could drop dead<br />
My mind was a prison-cell<br />
Of all the evil thoughts<br />
Caused by disillusion<br />
I ran outta love</p>

<p>That's life<br />
But I'm changed forever more<br />
That's life<br />
No I don't crawl anymore<br />
That's life<br />
I finally feel the power in me</p>

<p>Chorus)</p>

<p>I feel the strength - time and again<br />
It takes me there<br />
To the world - to the place<br />
Where the heart is high<br />
I'll reach the top - I won't give up<br />
I'll find my love<br />
No I never know<br />
Who I can be without a try</p>

<p>Maybe my demands are much too high<br />
But can't you see for less<br />
I'd rather die<br />
I love you - love you<br />
True - true - true - true<br />
True love never dies</p>

<p>I am the answer myself<br />
I searched so long - I went so wrong<br />
I lived a lie</p>

<p>Just feel the power forever - ever<br />
There's no - no turning back<br />
No there's no - no turning back<br />
No there's no turning back for you<br />
For you - just for you</p>
