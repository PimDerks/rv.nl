I"9<p>I know what it is<br />
Feeling lonely and lost in yourself<br />
I know how it feels<br />
When you can't find the cure on a shelf<br />
Will you always be sad<br />
For the rest of your life<br />
Never forget that it cuts like a knife<br />
Colours your world like a painting<br />
In all kinds of blue</p>
