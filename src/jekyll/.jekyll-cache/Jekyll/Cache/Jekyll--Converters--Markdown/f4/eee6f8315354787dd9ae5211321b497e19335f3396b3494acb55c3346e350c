I"W<p>Alone in the dark - thinking 'bout our love<br />
We came so far but never close enough<br />
Time was on our side - so how could we divide<br />
I never felt such a pain before</p>

<p>Love seems so far away - Oh I wish that I could die<br />
Why can't we give it another try</p>

<p>Tears in my eyes, another in your life<br />
I can't believe it's what you're looking for<br />
But I cannot forget - the better times we shared<br />
Why can't we love like those memories</p>

<p>They're not so far away - are they so hard to remain<br />
The things we felt before - or is this song still in vain</p>

<p>Love's not meant for me, love is a fantasy<br />
I keep searching forever<br />
Love's no friend of mine<br />
My love-life sun will never shine<br />
Search for the thing I can never find<br />
Your love</p>

<p>Hold me tight, let me help you win this fight<br />
I can give you love forever<br />
Roll the dice, I don't want to love on lies<br />
'Cause I still keep this feeling - I still keep this feeling...</p>

<p>Your love...<br />
I don't wanna miss you</p>

<p>I will always love you...</p>
