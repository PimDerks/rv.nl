I"{<p>You want the big screen - you want a fast car<br />
But every time in vain you try<br />
To write a hit song - become a rock star<br />
Relentlessly the years go by<br />
I love you - I hate you<br />
I'll take it all anyway you want to<br />
I'll help you, stand by you<br />
But now it's time you're gonna get through</p>

<p>(And) Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face now!<br />
Left-right! Hey! Left-Right! Hey!<br />
Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face!</p>

<p>I watch the big screen, it's Gwen Stefani<br />
With Linda Perry's song this time<br />
Oh now I know how Bobby McFerrin feels<br />
Return the favour in the chorus line<br />
Don't worry, I ain't happy<br />
But don't let it stop your jeer upon me<br />
So hate me, deny me<br />
Go chase the herd you follow blindly!</p>

<p>I don't bow for a humanoid<br />
I don't bow for a humanoid<br />
I don't. I don't. I don't bow for a humanoid. I don't bow.<br />
I wish 'em all dead. Hey dead. Hey dead. Hey dead. Hey<br />
Hey hey hey hey hey hey<br />
Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face</p>
