<p>Just another heartache, that's what they say<br />
This ever growing void will go away<br />
But they don't understand it<br />
You're everything I hoped to find since I was young<br />
And now you're gone</p>

<p>It's not another heartache, been there before<br />
It's not another loss, it's so much more<br />
It must be my biggest nightmare that's haunting me<br />
I don't believe in reality<br />
God it's killing me</p>

<p>Is there a way to lose a memory<br />
'Cause I can't take this anymore/p&gt;

<p>How long - don't let me wait another year<br />
You hold the key to my world<br />
How long - you're my home, my destiny<br />
With out you life is just a cold and lonely lie</p>

<p>It's not another romance that died too soon<br />
It cut away my heart a fatal wound<br />
I never felt so certain about anything<br />
I still believe in you and me<br />
Don't let me bleed</p>

<p>Is there a change that you'll come back to me<br />
Why did you have to let me go?/p&gt;

<p>How long - don't let me wait another year<br />
You hold the key to my world<br />
How long - you're my home, my destiny<br />
With out you life is just a cold and lonely lie</p>


<p>How long - don't let me wait another year<br />
You hold the key to my world<br />
How long - you're my home, my destiny<br />
With out you life is just a cold and lonely lie/p&gt;

<p>Don't let me drown in all my tears<br />
You hold the key to my heart<br />
How long - you're my home, my destiny<br />
Without you... life is just a cold and lonely lie</p>
</p></p></p>
