Dear Mr. DJ, can you play my song?<br />
It's rather catchy,  only three minutes long<br />
Hey Mr. DJ,  can't you give me a break?<br />
A bit of (f)airplay that is all that it takes</p>

<p>But he said:</p>

<p>Even if I dig it , if I think it's real good<br />
There's nothing that I can do<br />
I got mouths to feed, gotta make ends meet<br />
I better not mess with the Radio Police<br />
Naa naa na na na naaa<br />
Naa naa na na na naaa</p>

<p>Dear Mr. DJ, tell me how does it feel<br />
To live the puppet-life where nothing is real<br />
Inside your mansion and your big shiny car<br />
You're just a slave who's told to kill the real stars</p>

<p>But he said:</p>

<p>It's not about music, it's not about art<br />
Screw everything coming from the heart<br />
I gotta kill their goals and corrupt their souls<br />
So I better not fuck with the Radio Police<br />
Naa naa na na na naaa<br />
Naa naa na na na naaa</p>

<p>You serve the serpent not the human race<br />
Don't you remember who you were<br />
You had such passion in your younger days<br />
What happened to the boy who's lost his only toy</p>

<p>Downwards we go â€“ shut off from the universe<br />
We're all sheople what do we know (4x)</p>
