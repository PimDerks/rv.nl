I"þ<p>Down and out I'm in my bed<br />
Robbed, abused and left for dead<br />
I rush towards the end inside my shell<br />
If only you could see me fall<br />
You'd come for help and crush the walls<br />
You'd pick me up and take me out of hell</p>

<p>Then we're gonna rock (Rock! Rock! Rock!)<br />
We're gonna roll (Roll! Roll! Roll! )<br />
We're gonna stand up to the man and get in control<br />
We're gonna fight (Fight! Fight! Fight!)<br />
Fight for the right (Fight! Fight! Fight!)<br />
We're gonna fight for rock 'n' roll</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>
<p>
We'll go on to the bitter end<br />
On to the bitter end - On to the bitter end<br />
We'll never stop - We won't give up<br />
On to the bitter end<br />
Until we drop and hit the floor</p>

<p>Rejected, teased, ridiculized<br />
Ignored, betrayed and pushed aside<br />
Don't ever try to swim against the tide<br />
They only want to see you fall<br />
In powder, pills and alcohol<br />
They'll haunt you down until the day you die</p>

<p>But we gotta rock (Rock! Rock! Rock!)<br />
We gotta roll (Roll! Roll! Roll!)<br />
We gotta stand up to the man and get in control<br />
We gotta fight (Fight! Fight! Fight!)<br />
Step into the light (Fight! Fight! Fight!)<br />
We got the right to rock 'n' roll</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Solo</p>

<p>It's not a choice, it's a reason to survive<br />
We gotta run - We gotta hide<br />
We gotta step into the light<br />
The Princes of the Night</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>
