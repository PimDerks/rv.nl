I"h<p>This life of emptiness controlled her mind<br />
So sure she would never find her way<br />
Inside her restless heart the rain didn't end<br />
She couldn't take it anymore</p>

<p>That night she realized the dream she had<br />
And opened her eyes for something new<br />
This life has failed again right before our eyes<br />
She couldn't face it anymore<br />
She couldn't face it anymore</p>

<p>Sometimes love never dies<br />
And feelings go on forever<br />
Sometimes you don't see through your eyes<br />
We share all our dreams together<br />
But in times of no disguise<br />
We can't fool ourselves with lies<br />
Cause we all miss you so</p>

<p>Drawn in desperate thoughts she carried on<br />
How lonely she felt, nobody knew<br />
The love she hoped to find was in another world<br />
She couldn't face it anymore<br />
She couldn't face it anymore</p>
