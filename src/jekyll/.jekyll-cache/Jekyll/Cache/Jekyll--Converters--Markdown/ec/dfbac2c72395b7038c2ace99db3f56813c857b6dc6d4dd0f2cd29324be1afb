I"s<p>Club Bombastic<br />
Just when I was only seventeen<br />
I was a misfit on the scene<br />
Nowhere that I wanted to be<br />
When everyone else was having fun<br />
I was at home or on the run<br />
the emptiness would get into me<br />
I want to be where the smiles were for real<br />
And the crowd looked like in Purple Rain<br />
Oooh me and my furry friends</p>
