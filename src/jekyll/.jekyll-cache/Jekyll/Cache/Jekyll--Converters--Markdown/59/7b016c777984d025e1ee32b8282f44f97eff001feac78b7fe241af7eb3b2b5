I"y<p>Everywhere I hear my name<br />
Makes me slightly go insane<br />
Like I just can't play this game<br />
People try to block my way<br />
Narrow-minded call me names<br />
No I just can't stay the same</p>

<p>Sometimes I wonder<br />
What's the reason for it all<br />
The earth is filled with fools<br />
Who want to see me fall<br />
But there's something<br />
Something telling me</p>

<p>Listen to the magic infinity<br />
Listen to the voice of your heart<br />
Living in a world<br />
You're not living in<br />
Try to see from afar<br />
(Try to see) how meaningless they are</p>

<p>Furtive vultures fly my way<br />
Twisting every word I say<br />
Begrudging me the light of day<br />
I never knew there's so much hate<br />
In every country - every state<br />
No wonder world-peace must wait</p>

<p>Barefoot I walk through all<br />
The splinters in my soul<br />
Why don't I realise<br />
They don't hurt at all<br />
'Cause there's someone<br />
Someone telling me</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Can't you see that deep inside<br />
We're all the same<br />
Why don't you see<br />
This heat can take the fire away<br />
All away</p>

<p>Everyone in every way<br />
Try to lose your sense of shame<br />
Life is just a game</p>

<p>Listen to the magic infinity<br />
Listen to the voice of your heart<br />
Living in a world<br />
You're still living in<br />
Try to see from afar<br />
(Try to see) how meaningless we are</p>

<p>(Infinity) - listen to the magic infinity<br />
Listen to the voice of your heart<br />
Living in a world<br />
You're still living in<br />
Try to see from the stars<br />
(Try to see) how meaningless we are</p>
