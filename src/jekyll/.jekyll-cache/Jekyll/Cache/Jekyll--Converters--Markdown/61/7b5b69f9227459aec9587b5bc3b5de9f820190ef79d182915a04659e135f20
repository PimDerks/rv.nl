I"]<p>Abandoned heart, abandoned home<br />
It's the only path I know<br />
Since she's been gone I lost my life<br />
It became a danger zone<br />
I'll be wishing on a star she'll come around (still we ride)<br />
Far away from home, far away from home</p>

<p>She, she is my destiny<br />
She is my history, colored me blue - oh<br />
She, she is a fantasy<br />
She must be make believe<br />
Too good to be true</p>

<p>Abandonded life, abandoned dream<br />
Where's the truth in hope and fear<br />
A change of heart, I can't believe<br />
Thought our love was meant to be<br />
I'll be waiting on the phone each day and night (tell me why)<br />
She ran away from home - ran away from home</p>

<p>She, she is my destiny<br />
She is my history, colored me blue - oh<br />
She, she is a fantasy<br />
She must be make believe<br />
Too good to be true</p>

<p>I'll be wishing on a star she'll come around (still we ride)<br />
Far away from home, far away from home</p>

<p>She (she's a killer) she is my destiny (she is my destiny)<br />
She is my history, colored me blue - oh<br />
She (she's a killer), she is a fantasy (my love)<br />
She must be make believe, my soulmate, my fantasy<br />
Why don't you come through - oh<br />
She (she's a killer), she's all my heart can see<br />
The only one made for me<br />
I'll always love you</p>

<p>Abandoned heart</p>
