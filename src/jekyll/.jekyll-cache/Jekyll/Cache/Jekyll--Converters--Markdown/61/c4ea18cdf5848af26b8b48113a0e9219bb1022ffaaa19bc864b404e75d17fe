I"²<p>Flown away, all the good is going nowhere<br />
Like the heart is pushed aside<br />
Blown away with the wind of truth and justice<br />
These are the days<br />
When the righteous dreams have gone away<br />
And no one even tries to carry on,<br />
I keep holding on</p>

<p>But I keep on searching,<br />
Searching for something<br />
Searching, searching for something so undefined<br />
Can I ever hold out this trial<br />
I will hold on to the Lord, forever more</p>

<p>Far away, from the land of hope and glory<br />
Helplessly marooned am I<br />
Fade away, all the virtues I believed in<br />
These are the days<br />
People hide inside their masquerade<br />
And no one ever helps me carry on,<br />
I keep rolling on&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Dreams never die, dreams never lie<br />
For the chosen few he favours<br />
Dreams never lie, dreams never die<br />
They live on for God the saviour<br />
I know it's right, why don't you try<br />
To get home with him tonight</p>

<p>Dreams never die<br />
Please bring me back to my love</p>

<p>In darkness and light, rain or shine<br />
This faith will always be mine<br />
And when the shadows reappear I think of you<br />
And feel the sounds you make me hear<br />
I can never be thankful enough<br />
You gave me the reason to live<br />
In times of loneliness, in times of love</p>

<p>Forgive me Father for I have sinned<br />
I must have been poisoned<br />
By the world I'm living in<br />
I'll never do it again,<br />
I will never do it again</p>

<p>But sometimes it's so hard which path to choose
But if I listen to my heart I will never lose<br />
I can feel the strength, I can feel the power<br />
Let me be your disciple until my final hour</p>

<p>Dreams never die, dreams never lie<br />
For the chosen few he favours<br />
Dreams never lie, dreams never die<br />
They live on for God the saviour<br />
I know it's right, why don't you try<br />
To get home with him tonight</p>

<p>Dreams never die, dreams never lie<br />
For the chosen few he favours<br />
Dreams never lie, dreams never die<br />
They live on for God, the saviour<br />
I know it's right, why don't you try<br />
To leave this empty road behind, forever more</p>
