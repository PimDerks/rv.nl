I"7<p>I walk down the street gonna buy something sweet<br />
Guess some sugar might hear<br />
Just for an hour or a minute or two<br />
Change the way that I feel</p>

<p>I had to be alone to get into the special zone<br />
But now I feel undone<br />
Just because I'm overdoses doesn't mean I'm bored<br />
with my baby</p>

<p>What would I do in a world without you<br />
You save my life<br />
Whenever I'm lost, you're guiding me all the way<br />
What would I do when I can't count on you<br />
within my life<br />
All that I say<br />
A magnum for everyday!</p>
