I"Y<p>Out of love<br />
What's left of your life<br />
You don't know<br />
How to go through this time<br />
Out of dreams<br />
You've drowned them in wine<br />
Just like something<br />
Has turned off your light</p>

<p>Sleepless nights - wasted days<br />
Lonely fights - all the way<br />
Isn't easy for you to survive<br />
But still there's something inside<br />
That keeps you alive</p>

<p>Raise your hands<br />
And try to feel the love forever<br />
Raise your hands<br />
Be your friend - your own friend</p>

<p>All the time<br />
You search for some faith<br />
But no one on earth seemed to care<br />
All your love has turned into hate<br />
Towards the world<br />
That is just so unfair</p>

<p>Lonely nights - lonely days<br />
Endless lies - unheard prayers<br />
Isn't easy for you to survive<br />
But there's a will deep inside<br />
That keeps you alive (try to find)</p>

<p>Raise your hands<br />
And try to feel the love forever<br />
Raise your hands<br />
Be your friend - your own friend</p>

<p>If you don't love yourself<br />
Then tell me who should do<br />
You gotta trust<br />
The soul you're related to<br />
Life is just a fading star<br />
It's going too fast<br />
So free your soul<br />
It's time</p>

<p>Raise your hands<br />
And try to feel the love forever<br />
Raise your hands<br />
Be your friend - your own friend</p>
