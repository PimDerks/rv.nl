I"w<p>Look at me I'm such a silly guy<br />
I try to ride against the wind<br />
Though I ain't hip don't want to live a lie<br />
Where's the world that I was living in</p>

<p>But it's all messed up and nowhere to go<br />
All dressed up, boy what do I know</p>

<p>Gimme love - sweet love<br />
Is there anyone out there who'll sympathize<br />
Gimme love - sweet love<br />
Trying to keep my head above the waves</p>

<p>Look at the world it's such a silly sight<br />
The meek follow everything that's in<br />
t-t-t-two wrong fads don't make a right<br />
Such a shame this craze is not my thing</p>

<p>But I'm all dressed up and nowhere to go<br />
All messed up 'cause what do I know</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Gimme love - sweet love<br />
Is there anyone out there who'll sympathize<br />
Gimme love - sweet love<br />
Try to find someone who'll (gimme love)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
