I"c<p>They say:<br />
He's what Santa's for children<br />
But never appears in some foolish man's clothes<br />
Faith's a dream through the window<br />
That brainwashed the mind, hypnotized the weak souls</p>

<p>But I cherish the memories I keep in my heart<br />
Growing up's faithless betrayals so unlikely they seem<br />
In a younger man's dream</p>

<p>Believing is seeing<br />
Believing is seeing so much more<br />
How can you say you're not sure... like before</p>

<p>They say:<br />
Are you searching for Jesus<br />
To comfort your heart and to save your tormented soul<br />
There's no truth in believing<br />
No explanation, no logic at all</p>

<p>But I cherish the innocent days that must die<br />
Yesterday's purity still makes a broken soul see<br />
The younger man's dream</p>

<p>Believing is seeing<br />
Believing is seeing so much more<br />
Why are we drifting offshore</p>

<p>Believing is seeing<br />
Believing is seeing so much more<br />
Why are we drifting offshore</p>

<p>Believing is seeing<br />
Believing is seeing so much more<br />
How can you say you're not sure... like before</p>
