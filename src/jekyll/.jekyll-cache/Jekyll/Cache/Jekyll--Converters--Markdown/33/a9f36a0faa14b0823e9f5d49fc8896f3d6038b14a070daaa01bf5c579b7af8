I"”<p>It's been so long ago<br />
Since you waved my love goodbye<br />
With sadness in your eyes<br />
You left me wondering why<br />
Yes I was hurt before<br />
But it never felt so strong<br />
Now I face the world so wrong<br />
Without you I can't go on</p>

<p>It's just the way I feel<br />
I know we're meant to be<br />
I'm praying day and night<br />
Why can't you see</p>

<p>Over and over again<br />
I feel the pain in my heart<br />
Can we make a brand new start<br />
Over and over again<br />
I keep on loving you<br />
There's no end</p>

<p>These times without you<br />
Turned my life into hell<br />
Everyone can see<br />
But no one can help<br />
I did the best I could<br />
To get you out of my mind<br />
To prove I'm not that blind<br />
But I just couldn't lie</p>

<p>Love is all I feel<br />
I know we're meant to be<br />
Don't waste our time too long<br />
Angel, angel come with me</p>
