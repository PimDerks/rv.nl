I"x<p>Help me doctor - give me something<br />
I'm going under - I'm going under<br />
It's my baby - since she left me<br />
I'm going under - I'm going under</p>

<p>All the disillusions<br />
All deceptions couldn't break me down (Couldn't break me down)<br />
But now I'm licking windows, pull my hair out<br />
I need something now<br />
Think I gotta be - gotta be - gotta be</p>

<p>Sedated - sedated - sedated - I gotta be...<br />
Sedated - sedated - sedated - sedate me now</p>

<p>Please dear doctor - can you help me<br />
I'm going under - I'm going under<br />
Give me something to forget her<br />
She is my wonder - my holy wonder</p>

<p>All the disappointments<br />
All the drama's couldn't break me down (Couldn't break me down)<br />
But since she's gone away I'm losing faith<br />
I can't breath no more<br />
Think I gotta be - gotta be - gotta be</p>

<p>Sedated - sedated - sedated - I gotta be...<br />
Sedated - sedated - sedated - sedate me now</p>

<p>No matter how I try to fool myself, try to cool myself, I gotta prove myself<br />
Ain't no freakin' medicine screwing up my mind</p>

<p>Sedated - sedated - sedated - don't wanna be...<br />
Sedated - sedated - sedated - don't wanna be...<br />
Sedated (I hate it) - sedated (I hate it) - sedated - don't wanna be<br />
Sedated (I hate it) - sedated (I hate it) - sedated<br />
Sedate me now</p>

<p>I'm going under</p>
