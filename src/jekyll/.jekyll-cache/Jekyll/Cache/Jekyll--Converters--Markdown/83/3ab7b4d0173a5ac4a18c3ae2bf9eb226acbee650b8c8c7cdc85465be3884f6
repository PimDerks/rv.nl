I"Û<p>All the time<br />
I keep searching for the answers<br />
To the questions in my mind<br />
The emptiness in my life</p>

<p>All my life<br />
I am looking for some chances
Just to guide me to the time<br />
Where I no longer have to<br />
Hide for the rain<br />
Fight against the pain<br />
I feel it every day<br />
Itâ€™s just so hard to carry on<br />
This way</p>

<p>Life goes by<br />
Iâ€™m still searching for the answers<br />
Iâ€™m still searching for the love<br />
The missing love in my life</p>

<p>This time<br />
Iâ€™m needing you to mention<br />
Just to guide me to the time<br />
Where I no longer have to<br />
Hide for the rain<br />
Fight against the pain<br />
I feel it every day<br />
Itâ€™s just so hard to carry on<br />
This way<br />
This way</p>

<p>(Guitar solo)</p>

<p>Where do I go when everyoneâ€™s against me?<br />
What is a goal when love is just a lie?<br />
On and on my faithless song <br />
For all those years I was so young<br />
Since Mercury just took my heart away (Roger and John Brian May)<br />
Since you sold my heart was cold <br />
I did not know the road to go<br />
It was not a dream<br />
Donâ€™t you know itâ€™s all a dream<br />
But itâ€™s not a dream</p>

<p>Please release me from this game<br />
Father canâ€™t you take the chain away?<br />
Help me save me from this pain<br />
(Something reminds me) Iâ€™ve got a life to give<br />
(Something defies me) and shows me how to live</p>

<p>Donâ€™t you know that youâ€™re not on your own?<br />
We will fight and find our goal<br />
No one ever dreamed this broken heart in me<br />
The loneliness I feel since memories have gone<br />
My swollen eyes will show you how I cry<br />
A broken heart inside<br />
Thatâ€™s what love has left behind<br />
Oooh thatâ€™s what love has left behind</p>

<p>How could you leave me for some average fool<br />
After she took my heart away?<br />
How could she throw away your soul so true?<br />
Still my love for her goes on<br />
(and on and on and on)</p>

<p>I will free me<br />
and the love I save for her<br />
And the love I save for her<br />
I still want her<br />
I love her<br />
I need her<br />
I adore her<br />
But Iâ€™m still so afraid that she donâ€™t care at all</p>

<p>No donâ€™t get me wrong<br />
Iâ€™ve waited for my baby for so long<br />
If Iâ€™m wrong Iâ€™m sure you let me know<br />
Now I just canâ€™t let it go</p>

<p>Iâ€™m just a prisoner whoâ€™s looking for love<br />
Iâ€™m just a victim Iâ€™m losing my trust<br />
Begging and praying a way through my tears<br />
Can you hear me hear me<br />
(Guitar) (Prisoner of love)<br />
Begging and praying a way through my tears<br />
Can you hear me hear me now</p>

<p>Donâ€™t you know where to go<br />
When the worldâ€™s aching me<br />
Tell me how tell me now<br />
Whereâ€™s the worldâ€™s taken me</p>

<p>Iâ€™m just a prisoner whoâ€™s losing his trust<br />
Dying for a little love<br />
Dying for a little love</p>

<p>Now I will find my way<br />
I love this way today<br />
That will be all I need<br />
To to succeed<br />
I inside<br />
I found my way through this time<br />
(through this time)</p>

<p>Now I no longer have to<br />
Hide for the rain<br />
Fight against the pain<br />
I feel it every day<br />
Itâ€™s just so hard to carry on<br />
This way (this way)<br />
(Have to) hide for the rain<br />
(Have to) fight against the pain<br />
I feel it every day<br />
Itâ€™s just so hard to carry on<br />
This way (this way this way)</p>

<p>I carry on<br />
This way<br />
(Yeah yeah yeah)</p>
