I"È<p>Drifting away from home<br />
Waiting for you it's leading me nowhere<br />
Try to hold on to times<br />
To things that have been - It's taking me nowhere<br />
Promises made to the full - I keep them to you<br />
You know I'll do anything to win back your heart again</p>

<p>How many times can we say forever?<br />
How many times can we fail the truth?<br />
It's a matter of faith<br />
So tell me how do I fake my heart?<br />
'Cause babe it's a shame we're apart</p>

<p>Working like some kind of fool<br />
It tore your apart - it's leading you nowhere<br />
Let me be there for you<br />
Your overstrained heart is taking you nowhere<br />
Baby this just ain't no use - I cry out to you<br />
Will you try to find me back in your heart again</p>

<p>How many times can we say forever?<br />
How many times can we fail the truth?<br />
It's a matter of faith<br />
So tell me how do I fake my heart?<br />
'Cause babe it's a shame we're apart</p>

<p>How many times can we say forever?<br />
How many times can we fail the truth?<br />
It's a matter of faith<br />
Baby how do I lie to my heart?<br />
'Cause babe it's a shame - it's such a shame<br />
Babe it's a shame we're apart</p>

<p>How many times, how many times...<br />
How many times, how many times...<br />
How many times, how many times...<br />
How many times, how many times...<br />
How many times, how many times...<br />
How many times, how many times...<br />
How many times, how many times...</p>
