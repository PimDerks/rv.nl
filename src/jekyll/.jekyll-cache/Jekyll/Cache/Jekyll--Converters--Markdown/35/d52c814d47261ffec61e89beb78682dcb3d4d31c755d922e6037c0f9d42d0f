I"Û<p>I fix my hair 'cause my baby comes at seven<br />
Changed my clothes about a million times today, yeah, yeah...<br />
Tonight's the night she will take me up to heaven<br />
I know this time we're going all the way</p>

<p>She is my new horizon<br />
She is so true, she is my moonshine (moonshine)<br />
What can I do about it?<br />
My life gets brighter every day</p>

<p>The doorbell rings, it must be her, it's almost seven<br />
but the bailiff's there with some bills I didn't pay...</p>

<p>Just as you expect your lover<br />
It's a neighbour or some clown<br />
Stupid milkman, total stranger<br />
What the hell is goin' down?</p>

<p>Hey, are you happy now - there's no one at the doorbell ringing - but yourself</p>

<p>I'm fixing dinner for my first blind-date ever<br />
and smoke is rising from the microwave, yeah, yeah<br />
The bell - jump up - eight-o-clock - it must be Heather<br />
but it's a fireman asking me "Where is the blaze?"</p>

<p>Just as you expect your lover<br />
It's a neighbour or some clown<br />
Stupid milkman, total stranger<br />
What the hell is goin' down?</p>

<p>Hey, are you happy now - there's no one at the doorbell ringing - but yourself</p>

<p>Busy postman, Dr. Labour - no policemen - turn me down<br />
no Jehova, nor a saviour, Hare Krishna turn around<br />
Clinton, Arafat or Hoessein, Prince &amp; Mayte go away<br />
Bill &amp; Monica or Jeltsin, Mr. Gates another day<br />
Luciella, Ellen, Cindy Crawford, Schiffer, McCarthey - neither way<br />
Please stop ringing Queen of Holland - maybe next time King of Spain<br />
Aldrin, Armstrong, Collins, Lovell - in fact, all NASA: blow away!<br />
Dave &amp; Goliath, Trojan Horses<br />
Zeus or Salamon, potatoes, China, Pakistan, Norway</p>
