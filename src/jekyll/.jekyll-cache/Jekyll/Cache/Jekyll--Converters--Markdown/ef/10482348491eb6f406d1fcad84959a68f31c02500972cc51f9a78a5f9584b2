I"ý<p>Stormy weather - where's my angel<br />
To protect me from the shadows<br />
Fucked and tired - painful memories<br />
Haunt me down and crossed the wires</p>

<p>Was it all my mistake<br />
All the choices that I made<br />
Soon I will be six feet underground</p>

<p>Save me - I'm out on my own<br />
Save me - can't make it alone<br />
In the darkness<br />
With no ray of hope left in sight</p>

<p>Save me - can't take it no more<br />
Out on the sea<br />
No sight of a shore to hold on to <br />
Don't let me pine away in my shell<br />
I don't know how to save myself</p>

<p>Holy father - send an angel<br />
To protect me from the shadows<br />
I am falling, slowly drift away<br />
Into the hands of freaks and failure</p>

<p>Yes I know it's my mistake<br />
When I brought her back that day<br />
But ever since my life is going down</p>

<p>Save me - I'm out on my own<br />
Save me - can't make it alone<br />
In the darkness<br />
With no ray of hope left in sight</p>

<p>Save me - can't take it no more<br />
Out on the sea<br />
No sight of a shore to hold on to<br />
Don't let me pine away in my shell<br />
I don't know how to save myself</p>

<p>Was it all my mistake<br />
When I brough her back that day<br />
Ever since my life is going down</p>

<p>Save me - I'm out on my own<br />
Save me - can't make it alone<br />
In the darkness<br />
There's no ray of hope - won't you</p>

<p>Save me - can't take it no more<br />
Out on the sea<br />
No sight of a shore to hold on to<br />
There's no ray of hope left in sight</p>

<p>Save me - my heart turns to stone<br />
I'm losing myself<br />
And I'm coming undone<br />
Won't you save me<br />
Don't let me pine away in my shell<br />
Save me from this living hell</p>

<p>I don't know how to save myself</p>
