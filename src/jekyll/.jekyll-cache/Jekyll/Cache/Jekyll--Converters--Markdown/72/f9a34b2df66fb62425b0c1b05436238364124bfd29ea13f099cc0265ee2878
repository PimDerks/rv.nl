I"<p>I believed in grandfather's way<br />
I chose to cherish my pride<br />
I was aware of the price I must pay<br />
I still have dreams left inside</p>

<p>My heart was filled with innocent trust<br />
But when I opened my eyes<br />
I was betrayed by the people I loved<br />
Their darkness clouded my skies<br />
Their weakness shattered our ties</p>

<p>Don't you believe the sun is dying sir<br />
(You don't know, no you don't know)<br />
Don't you believe in stars and signs<br />
(Gone in a wink of an eye)<br />
Don't you believe in magic<br />
Don't you believe in magic<br />
Feeding the feud till you die</p>

<p>In this world of hate and mistrust<br />
I'm scared to open my eyes<br />
This is no place for a child to grow up<br />
Where greed and power entice<br />
Where dreams are murdered by lies</p>

<p>On my own through the desert<br />
On my own through the land<br />
Let me take all the children by the hand<br />
And I'll give them a future<br />
And I'll give them a hope<br />
That you fools on the earth don't understand</p>
