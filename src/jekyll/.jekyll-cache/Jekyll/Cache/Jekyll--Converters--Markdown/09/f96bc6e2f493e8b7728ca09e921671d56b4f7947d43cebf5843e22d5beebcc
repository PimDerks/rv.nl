I"ä	<p>I walk alone beneath the stars<br />
I hear you - inspiration's calling me<br />
And I thank you on my knees<br />
For the way you make my life complete</p>

<p>Yes I know that life's unsure<br />
I give my heart and soul to get it right<br />
But if anything goes wrong<br />
I always know my heart will carry on</p>

<p>Oh I believe in you<br />
The strength is on my side<br />
You help me thru' and thru'<br />
And give me back my pride<br />
This song you hear I dedicate to you</p>

<p>Oh God she's always on my mind<br />
She's the girl that was so hard to find<br />
Never felt like this before<br />
She's the one I will love forever more</p>

<p>I feel that this is meant to be<br />
Never knew she had so much in store<br />
And if time is on our side<br />
I surely know my heart will carry on</p>

<p>Oh I believe in her<br />
The strength is on my side<br />
Now I can face the world<br />
And split the wrong from right<br />
The feeling grows<br />
I'm finally coming through</p>

<p>There were days<br />
When all these words were hard to find<br />
Living in this world without a friend<br />
How hard I tried - they got in the way<br />
I could never sing till the end</p>

<p>But I still believe<br />
That I catch the magic sound<br />
I just won't give up trying<br />
Till you are around</p>

<p>Love left you - would I ever start again<br />
(Fighting for an answer)<br />
So lonely - reach out for a helping hand<br />
(Living without your love)<br />
No one can hear me - no one will fear me<br />
I'm so shy - I wonder why</p>

<p>Living in a home without a heart<br />
I thought of moving out<br />
I've been waitin' for a brand new start<br />
Now I can face the crowd</p>

<p>Oh you tried to get along<br />
(Everything went wrong)<br />
Nowhere to belong - wasn't easy to survive<br />
Yes so hard to carry on with a fear so strong<br />
Like you're losing all the time</p>

<p>Give it - no - give it - no<br />
Give your soul and you'll be free<br />
Give it - no - give it - no<br />
Then we'll never let it be<br />
Will you still be there<br />
If you do believe in this dream<br />
You know it's plain to see<br />
(You and me)<br />
Go - go</p>

<p>Love so strong - here's where I belong<br />
And I leave the fears behind<br />
Till the end of time</p>

<p>And I'm sure I'll find my way<br />
'Cause I know the words to say<br />
Yes I'm sure it won't be long<br />
'Cause I know I'm not alone</p>

<p>Oh I never - no I never<br />
Oh I never lose my faith in you<br />
I believe in you</p>
