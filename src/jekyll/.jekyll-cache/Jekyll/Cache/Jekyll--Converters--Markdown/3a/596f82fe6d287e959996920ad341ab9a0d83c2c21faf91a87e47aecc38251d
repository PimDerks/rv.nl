I"K<p>Deep down I went day by day<br />
To find the one inside<br />
Life became a stranger<br />
Locked behind the fright<br />
But you're the one I'm searching for<br />
You can stop my fall<br />
Take me back to better times<br />
Those I might recall</p>

<p>Love is the only thing<br />
The only thing I need<br />
Open up the haze<br />
Blow the magic breeze</p>

<p>Just one minute of your life<br />
Heals the wound inside<br />
Takes me out of nowhere<br />
Solves the questions in my heart<br />
That tore me all apart<br />
And set me free<br />
'Cause time won't let me be</p>

<p>Will I ever live my dreams<br />
If no one seems to hear<br />
Voices of a strange and<br />
Undeniable fear<br />
It's hard to take those magic steps<br />
When everyone demands<br />
I can't go on like this<br />
I have to take a chance</p>

<p>You are the only one<br />
The only one I need<br />
Open up the haze<br />
Blow the magic breeze</p>

<p>I keep hiding in disguise<br />
All my life thru' different eyes<br />
Tell me what it takes<br />
Till you believe in me<br />
'Cause I believe in you</p>
