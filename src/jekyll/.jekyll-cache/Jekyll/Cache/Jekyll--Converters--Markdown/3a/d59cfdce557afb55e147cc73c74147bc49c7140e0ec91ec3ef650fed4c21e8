I"I<p>Father I have failed you<br />
time after time<br />
You know I disobeyed you<br />
You know I was blind<br />
to all the earthly wishes<br />
to all the earthly sins<br />
to all the wrong addiction<br />
You know just where I've been<br />
Please give me one more chance</p>

<p>I won't blame nobody<br />
I know there's no excuse<br />
I broke the promise<br />
Ooh I deserve to lose<br />
All the magic power<br />
the healing of Your hands<br />
Forgive me for my weakness<br />
Forgive me for my sins<br />
Can't you give me one more chance</p>

<p>'Cause I'm back<br />
Back on the track<br />
Back on the road again<br />
Opened my eyes, now I know<br />
Well I'm back<br />
Back on the track<br />
I'm  coming home again<br />
Free from the lies<br />
I am born again</p>

<p>Since I was a young boy<br />
I knew where to go<br />
But time had blurred my vision<br />
How could I know<br />
But ever since I've known You<br />
there's meaning to my life<br />
Please give me back the passion<br />
The goal for which I strive<br />
Can't you give me one more chance</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>I lost my destination<br />
I lost my inspiration<br />
Soothed my soul<br />
with all the sequential lies<br />
I sank in deep frustration<br />
I failed to find salvation<br />
Won't You take me home<br />
Father, take me home</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
