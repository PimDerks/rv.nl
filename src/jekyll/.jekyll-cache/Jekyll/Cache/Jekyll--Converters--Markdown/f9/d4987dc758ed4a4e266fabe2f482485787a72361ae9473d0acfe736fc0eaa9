I"ß<p>In the beginning of â€™98 I started recording No Sugar Added. Initially rather inspired to do something slightly different. A bit edgier, less â€˜bombastâ€™ and less orchestrated than the general feel on the previous albums. New songs, like <a href="/music/songs/the-forces-of-secrecy/">The Forces Of Secrecy</a>, <a href="/music/songs/train-against-the-grain">Train Against The Grain</a>, <a href="/music/songs/reincarnated-virtually/">Reincarnated Virtually</a>, <a href="/music/songs/its-all-about/">Itâ€™s All About...</a> came quickly. While I wanted to take that new approach much further I got blocked. Usually I would wait, sometimes for months, to get the inspiration back. But I wanted this album to come out quickly.</p>
