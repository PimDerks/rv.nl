I"Ñ<p>Inspired by some â€˜New Romanticâ€™ bands from the mid 80â€™s and David Bowie from that era. First time I sang lower than I usually do. I tried to get a bit of an 80â€™s sound in the production. Again some things are taken from the demo I couldnâ€™t get better: the Lead vocal and guitar solo. Most of the drums is a drum machine programmed. Recorded this song 3 times. Twice with real drums, but in the end it asked for a tighter, more mechanical approach.</p>
