I"ï<p>Day by day - someone goes astray<br />
To join the masses, another soul decays<br />
So much is lost and nothing ever gained<br />
Leads to disaster, to the agony's refrain</p>

<p>One look at the world today<br />
Made me realize the truth has lost its way</p>

<p>Where do we go from here<br />
Now all our dreams have slowly disappeared<br />
Where do we go from here<br />
Living a lie , that's what we're doing here</p>

<p>On and on - greed wins the war<br />
Where is the magic, we used to feel before<br />
The Midas touch has turned your heart to stone<br />
Just show repentance before your chance is gone</p>

<p>Dear world, humanity will pay<br />
If we go on believing evil ways</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
