<p>When I look at myself in the mirror<br />
I see a broken soul<br />
With no more sense to fight<br />
Oh I hate what I see in the mirror<br />
Sometimes I feel the need<br />
To leave this life behind</p>

<p>I know that things go well<br />
And I have to be ashamed<br />
I know that I'm a fool<br />
To think of leaving this game<br />
Oh Lord will you help me spell my name</p>

<p>All I wish is the strength<br />
That gets me up again<br />
To write a thousand songs<br />
To run the million miles<br />
All I want is some self-respect<br />
To become my friend<br />
Then I can move the mountains<br />
I would never climb</p>

<p>I know it's just a stage<br />
That I'm going through<br />
But somehow it'll always<br />
Lead me begging to you<br />
Oh Lord will you help me spell my name</p>

<p>But still I'm hurting the few<br />
That I really love<br />
I feel like a fool<br />
Will they understand<br />
Will they try to see<br />
That it's so hard to be me</p>

<p>I know I'm such a fool<br />
To be unhappy now<br />
But every single day<br />
I feel more lonesome somehow<br />
Oh please will you help me<br />
Oh please will you help me<br />
Oh please will you help me spell my name<br />
Oh Lord - will you help me find my way</p>
