<p>Morinezumi, Morinezumi, I love to love you<br />
I saw you roam, I took you home<br />
Morinezumi, Morinezumi, can't live without you<br />
Now all your nightmares are gone</p>

<p>Life without fear and life without a tear<br />
Something we dream about<br />
Now that you're here I'll be a better sonneteer<br />
Waltzing with Mori the mouse</p>

<p>Morinezumi, Morinezumi, I love to love you<br />
I saw you roam, I took you home<br />
Morinezumi, Morinezumi, can't live without you<br />
Now all your nightmares are gone</p>
