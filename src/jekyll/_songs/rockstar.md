<p>No class, no style, no shame<br />
    A poser in the coloured lights<br />
    No love, no shine, no pain<br />
    A superficial freakshow</p>

<p>You think it's such a shame<br />
    Your picture's not in the hall of fame<br />
    You lived your life a lie<br />
    But you don't know the reason why</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>So you think you are a rockstar<br />
    Put your money where your mouth is<br />
    You tell the crowd to come on, come on, come on, come<br />
    But you, you don't deliver<br />
    Look in the mirror you're no rockstar<br />
    You're just an overrated has-been<br />
    I'm telling you to come on, come on, come on, come on<br />
    Go home back in your cage<br />
    Get off the stage</p>

<p>No love, no life, no stage<br />
    Locked inside the powder room<br />
    No heart, no soul, no faith<br />
    You sold them at the crossroads</p>

<p>It's such a crying shame<br />
    You've got no star on the walk of fame<br />
    You made your mother cry<br />
    But you don't know the reason why</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus)</p>
