title: Schizophonicated
year: 2014-01-01
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: This song is about the battle between several voices inside the head of a person lost in an unfulfilled ambition. Or… it can also be about someone trapped in a relationship. That’s what it looks like in the beginning. It’s another Muse-minded composition.

<p>I don't want you , I don't need you<br />
    Sick to death to do my best to please you<br />
    Never enough, it's never right<br />
    Suffocated, manipulated In this mess forever isolated<br />
    I just can't stand it one more night</p>

<p>Why are we holding on<br />
    No chance and too far gone<br />
    Should have known it all along<br />
    We don't belong</p>

<p>Blood related, it's overrated<br />
    Cross my heart wish we could separate it<br />
    But there's no release in suicide<br />
    But I don't want it, I don't need it<br />
    This poisoned chalice, to the core defeated<br />
    I wear my cross, buried alive</p>

<p>Why are we holding on<br />
    No chance and too far gone<br />
    Should have known it all along<br />
    We don't belong</p>

<p>I put my faith in you, I trust my life to you<br />
    God knows I ache for you, fight for you, die for you<br />
    Affliction, addiction, it's just a fools conviction<br />
    Aggrieving, deceiving, stupendous make-believing<br />
    Denying, belying, my bleeding heart is dying over you, over you</p>

<p>Why are we holding on<br />
    No chance and too far gone<br />
    Can't be crawling on and on... on and on ...</p>

<p>Why am I holding on<br />
    No chance and too far gone<br />
    I took this torture for much too long<br />
    I don't belong here</p>
