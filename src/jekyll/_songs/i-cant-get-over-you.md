about: |
  Just piano and vocal . I had the grand-piano tuned for recording most of the piano’s on the album. Once that was done I kept on playing through the night because the sound of the piano, all miked-up, through the headphones , was very inspiring.

  Instantly I wrote this song and recorded it. Captured the atmosphere at the moment the song was as close within me as possible. I wanted this to be a hidden track but mentioned it on the track-list after all, because I don’t want it to be missed.

  The quickest song I’ve ever written and the first I recorded right after writing it. It’s actually one of my favourites on this record.

<p>Baby it's late, I'm so down and out<br />
Drown myself over you<br />
The longer I wait, the more I doubt<br />
Was it just a phase that we went through<br />
On the wings of love we flew a record-high<br />
Can't believe it was meant to pass by<br />
No I can't stop loving you<br />
Nothing helps, no matter how I try<br />
Torn, being ignored, babe it froze me to the core<br />
But still it's you I'm living for</p>

<p>Counting the days, these long lonesome hours<br />
I lost myself since I lost you<br />
Then this is my fate - alone in the crowd<br />
Forever screwed - crying over you<br />
Just my biggest dream turned out to be a lie<br />
But I just can't lay down and die<br />
No I can't stop loving you<br />
Nothing works, no matter how I try<br />
Torn, being ignored, babe it froze me to the core<br />
But still it's you I'm living for</p>

<p>You never told me we were through<br />
So what did you expect I would do?<br />
To forget it all? No...</p>

<p>I can't get over you<br />
I never will, no matter how I try<br />
Love of my life, you're the reason to survive<br />
Do you really think that I just can stop loving you?<br />
Without a word, without a reason why<br />
So cruel, that ain't you - tell me love, what is the truth?<br />
Baby please, one sign of life<br />
I just need to know if you're alright</p>
