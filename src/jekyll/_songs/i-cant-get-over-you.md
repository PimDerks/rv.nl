Just piano and vocal . I had the grand-piano tuned for recording most of the piano’s on the album. Once that was done I kept on playing through the night because the sound of the piano, all miked-up, through the headphones , was very inspiring.
Instantly I wrote this song and recorded it. Captured the atmosphere at the moment the song was as close within me as possible.
I wanted this to be a hidden track but mentioned it on the track-list after all, because I don’t want it to be missed.
The quickest song I’ve ever written and the first I recorded right after writing it.
It’s actually one of my favourites on this record.
