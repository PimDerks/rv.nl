<p>Memories on a lonely night<br/>
Make me feel all the pain inside<br/>
Since you've been gone<br/>
This life seems so wrong</p>

<p>I understand why you had to go<br/>
I understand why you felt so low<br/>
(Low with me)<br/>
I was too young and so insecure</p>

<p>I don't blame you for leaving me<br/>
I guess I'd have done the same thing<br/>
If I were you<br/>
But you don't see<br/>
What life has done to me<br/>
I still believe in you and me</p>

<p>Baby don't make me wait forever<br/>
We're having this dream together<br/>
Hoping that someday - someday<br/>
Baby don't make me wait till heaven<br/>
'Cause we can fulfil this magic<br/>
Wishing that someday we'll be one</p>

<p>Oh if you only were here<br/>
Together eternally - oh hold me</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Baby - no one can wait forever<br/>
Don't let us miss this magic<br/>
Why can't you be here<br/>
Love of my life</p>
