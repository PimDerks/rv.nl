about: |
  A slow, heavy-beat instrumental based on a metal guitar rif. Nop Ton plays a killer drum-track recorded in Fendal. It sounds like an exodus of elephants. Trying to say with this: habits die hard in the mind of an elephant. The creature with the biggest memory and a slow pace . The ‘exodus’ of moving on in life doesn’t happen over night. Gone is the new positive attitude like in the song before. Back in the rain again that leads into the next solitary track.
