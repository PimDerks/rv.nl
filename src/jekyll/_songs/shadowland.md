<p>He is a girl, she is a boy<br />
Its very complicated<br />
Within the world, inside the void<br />
Depressed and captivated<br />
Why why why<br />
He was born to live a lie lie lie<br />
Sometimes he wished that she could die die die<br />
But she will never be denied</p>

<p>She's not a boy, he is a girl<br />
She feels so liberated<br />
He made a choice, she will unfurl<br />
He will be terminated<br />
Die, die, die,<br />
Now it's time to say goodbye, bye, bye<br />
No more living in a lie, lie, lie<br />
But left his parents wondering why?</p>

<p>One summer night<br />
she dropped the bomb<br />
One summer night it all went wrong</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>On the way to find her destination<br />
Leaving hell to get to Neverland<br />
Stepping out the prison cell<br />
Into the fires of hell<br />
It just ain't right, this endless fight<br />
Fell into a world of isolation<br />
Never made it to the promised land<br />
Never felt so all alone<br />
It turned her heart to stone<br />
Footsteps in the sand<br />
All the way to Shadowland</p>

<p>Now he's a girl, oh what a joy<br />
So many years she'd waited<br />
But in the world she'd be avoided<br />
Set aside and hated<br />
Why, why, why<br />
And all his friends had said goodbye, bye, bye<br />
Running out of tears to cry, cry, cry<br />
But she won't ever be denied</p>

<p>One summer night it all went wrong<br />
One summer night the fight was on - and on</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>One summer night it all went wrong<br />
One summer night the fight went on - and on</p>

<p>On the way to find her destination<br />
Leaving hell to get to Neverland<br />
Stepping out the prison cell<br />
Into the fires of hell<br />
It just ain't right<br />
This endless fight</p>

<p>On the way to find her destination<br />
Leaving hell to get to Neverland<br />
Stepping out the prison cell<br />
Into the fires of hell<br />
It just ain't right, This endless fight<br />
Fell into a world of isolation<br />
Never made it to the promised land<br />
Never felt so all alone<br />
It turned her heart to stone<br />
But remember my friend,<br />
Know that in the end,<br />
We're all lost in shadowland</p>
