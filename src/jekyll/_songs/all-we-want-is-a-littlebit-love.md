<p>Bye, bye, gone in the sky<br />
My friends are all grown up and I'm still a child<br />
but now I'm feeling I'm stuck in my cocoon<br />
its' me I'm seeing through</p>

<p>Bye, bye, wonderful sounds<br />
All my heroes have been turned into clowns<br />
I rather hold my horses, quit and come clean<br />
There's nothing in between</p>

<p>Take a look at me, now<br />
Would you act like me?<br />
Take a look at me, now<br />
Take a loot at me!</p>

<p>All we want is a little bit Love! (...A littlebit Love!)<br />
All we want is a little bit Love! (...A littlebit Love!)<br />
All we want is a little bit Love! (...A littlebit Love!)</p>

<p>We want love!</p>

<p>Life, life, the harder I try<br />
Prefer to go to sleep and dream til' I die<br />
Bye, bye, big attitude<br />
bet ya babe, I miss my youth</p>

<p>Take a look at me, now<br />
Would you act like me?<br />
Take a look at me, now<br />
Take a loot at me!</p>

<p>All we want is a little bit Love! (...A littlebit Love!)<br />
All we want is a little bit Love! (...A littlebit Love!)<br />
All we want is a little bit Love! (...A littlebit Love!)</p>

<p>We want love!</p>
