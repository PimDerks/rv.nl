<p>I see you sitting in the classroom<br />
It seems you're doing alright<br />
So I walk away to the car<br />
Feel the tears well up in my eyes</p>

<p>I can't believe where did the time go<br />
So suddenly you turned four<br />
But I ain't ready yet, not by far<br />
No I can't let you out of my sight</p>

<p>Oh it's too soon, you're still so vulnerable<br />
Or is it just me who can't let go<br />
A pain in my chest, a hole in my past<br />
It's going too fast</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Baby when you're all grown up one day<br />
I might not be in this world that day<br />
But bear in your mind, deep in your heart<br />
I'll be there<br />
All you have to do is call my name<br />
Every time your heart's in disarray<br />
This is the truth<br />
I will always be watching over you</p>

<p>I held your hand inside the cradle<br />
Or else you couldn't fall asleep<br />
Now you ride your bike, sing your own songs<br />
And climb the highest tree</p>

<p class="em">Eleanor Robyn</p>

<p>I can't believe how fast you're growing<br />
A little bigger each day<br />
You're so beautiful and full of life<br />
But I can't keep up with the pace</p>

<p>There comes a time, you'll get away from us<br />
Into the world, I hate to know<br />
A pain in my chest, a hole in my past<br />
It's going too fast</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Solo</p>

<p>I saw you sitting in the class room<br />
You were looking so sad<br />
How it breaks my heart<br />
I fight the urge to take you home again</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Eleanor Robyn...</p>
