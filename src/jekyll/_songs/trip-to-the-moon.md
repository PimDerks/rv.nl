<p>Play me a song I can drown into<br />
    I got first class tickets for a trip to the moon<br />
    I got blue, pink... Jesus all I'm trying to do<br />
    Is shoot the rain away</p>

<p>Deep, dark, black, brought the record back<br />
    Don't care tonight could cause a major panic-attack<br />
    I need a touch of heaven, gotta give me some slack<br />
    And push the clouds away</p>

<p>Baby just come on, prepare for the ride<br />
    Hold on, hold on tight</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Aaaaaaaaahh aaaaaaaahh - Baby you turn me on<br />
    You shake, shake, shake it just right - Come on honey!<br />
    Aaaaaaaaahh aaaaaaahh - Baby you burn them all<br />
    We'll stay awake 'til the morning light - Come on honey!</p>

<p>The DJ's playing a song you are dancing to<br />
    In just high heals baby I'm watching you heels<br />
    With my hand in my pocket and your clothes in my shoe<br />
    You drive the crowd insane</p>

<p>I wear my one sleeved shirt and my leather flares<br />
    Long hair, black nails, everyone stares<br />
    Too much eye-liner, babe we're such a freaky pair<br />
    We blow them all away</p>

<p>We gotta roll on, speed up the ride<br />
    Hold on, hold on tight</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus x 2)</p>
