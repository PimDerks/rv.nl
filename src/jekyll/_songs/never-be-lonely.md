<p>Never be lonely in the night<br />
'Cause I'll be here</p>

<p>Time here is nothing but a test, dear<br />
Time enough to choose, the echo in your ear<br />
My dear, it's plain you must be sincere<br />
Then He won't let you lose the game all people fear</p>

<p>Sometimes your mind don't know<br />
What-t-to do - I hear it too<br />
No need for being insecure</p>

<p>Never be lonely in the night<br />
'cause I'll be here (Your Valentine)<br />
Never be lonely now (let me be)<br />
Your shelter for life</p>

<p>Don't fear the challenge that you got here<br />
Turn the sin into sound, the echo in your ear<br />
Life here is filled with love and hate, dear<br />
Don't let it bring you down, don't let it get you near</p>

<p>I couldn't always be with you<br />
What could I do (but now I'm here)<br />
So leave this self-destructive war</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>I believe we are the lonely one<br />
Always searching for what's right<br />
But we're not the only one<br />
Who sinned and sobbed inside<br />
Why don't we feel the strength<br />
'Cause we can turn the tide<br />
But don't you kill the child</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Let's reconcile again</p>
