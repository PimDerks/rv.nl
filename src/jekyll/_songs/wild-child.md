<p>Darling's on the run<br />
For a world so wrong<br />
Don't know where to go<br />
Lost and all alone<br />
There's no way back home<br />
Daddy let her know</p>

<p>No one understands<br />
What's running through her head<br />
No one seems to care<br />
When she's drifting so sad<br />
Like she never finds a way somehow</p>

<p>Wild child<br />
There's a place in my heart<br />
There's a space in my life<br />
Left for you<br />
Wild child<br />
Just don't push it too far<br />
Try to see<br />
That your dreams can come through<br />
'Cause babe I still rely on you</p>

<p>Waiting for so long<br />
For the love to come<br />
Seems an endless fight<br />
Rambling on and on<br />
While it all goes wrong<br />
In this chanceless life</p>

<p>No one ever knows<br />
What's hidden deep inside<br />
All the bitterness<br />
Seems frozen in her mind<br />
Like it never fades away somehow</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>It's just a year ago<br />
When I saw you walking by<br />
How could you get that low<br />
It makes me wanna cry<br />
I will try to find an answer<br />
I will try to understand<br />
If you give me just<br />
One more chance</p>

<p>Wild child - ooh - ooh<br />
There's a place in my heart<br />
Wild child - ooh - ooh<br />
There's a place in my heart</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Woh - woh - woh - woh<br />
Woh - woh - woh - woh<br />
There's a place in my heart<br />
Wild child - woh - woh<br />
Where it all can come true<br />
Babe I'm still in love with you</p>
