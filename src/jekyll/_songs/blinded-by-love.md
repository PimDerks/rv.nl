<p>Here I am blinded by tears<br />
from the hurting inside<br />
What is left of love so sincere<br />
now it all seems a lie<br />
It's hard to be strong<br />
cause you're still the only one<br />
With tears in my eyes<br />
I tell you that it's over (it's over)</p>

<p>I'm so tired of losing myself<br />
in someone like you<br />
Everytime you just put me through hell<br />
with love so untrue<br />
I just can't hold on<br />
to something that seems so wrong<br />
With pain in my heart<br />
I tell you that it's over (it's over)</p>

<p>Blinded by love - living on fantasy<br />
Blinded by love - all for a memory<br />
I just closed the door to this ravishing lie</p>

<p>So unfair you don't let me in<br />
but you can't let me go<br />
Heartless bitch, you've broken my wings<br />
So don't give me hope<br />
I got to be strong<br />
cause you're still the only one<br />
With tears in my eyes<br />
I tell you that it's over (it's over)</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Solo</p>

<p>I opened my eyes now I see through your disguise<br />
At last I can leave this shame behind</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Blinded by love - living on fantasy<br />
Blinded by love - all for a memory<br />
I just closed the door to the shame in my life</p>

<p>Blinded by your love</p>
