<p>On the move on the prowl<br />
on the wings of an owl<br />
Life keeps on telling us lies<br />
Taught us to believe in a world<br />
that we should despise<br />
Where's the truth on the streets<br />
for the people in need<br />
Everyone's passing them by<br />
Fortunate ones only care<br />
for their own Christmas night</p>

<p>All the presents get bigger<br />
the greedier they get<br />
Spirit of Christmas<br />
How can they forget?</p>

<p>Christmas in heaven is oh so fair and true<br />
So innocent and pure<br />
There's it's always like Christmas time<br />
Christmas in heaven, it's all misunderstood<br />
We should celebrate it like they do<br />
It's a much better Christmas time<br />
For everyone</p>

<p>On the move on the prowl<br />
on the wings of an owl<br />
Refugees fear for their lives<br />
Leaving their homes far behind<br />
For a safe place to hide ooooh<br />
For the truth people die<br />
Oh I just don't know why<br />
This world is a place full of lies<br />
Everyday of this life<br />
Is a cold Christmas night</p>

<p>All the wishes are based on material success<br />
The spirit of Christmas<br />
How can they forget?</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Christmas in heaven is oh so fair and true<br />
So innocent and pure<br />
There's it's always like Christmas time<br />
Christmas in heaven, it's all misunderstood<br />
We should celebrate it like they do<br />
It's a much better Christmas time<br />
It's a much better Christmas time<br />
(much better world)<br />
For everyone</p>
