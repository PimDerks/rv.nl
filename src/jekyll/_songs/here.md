‘In this place of make-believe I slowly die’ ….
On the verge of giving up hope, but still trying to hold on to the dream once shared with the one for whom most of these songs are written about.
Mid-tempo pop/rock song with a slice of metal , and a mysteriously sounding verse that’s coming right out of no-mans land.
