composer: Robby Valentine
about: |
  My Brian May version to the theme from the ‘Back To The Future’ movie. It’s one of my all time favourite movies. Think I will use it as a show opener. It sounds like pure Victory. Such a brilliant composition of Alan Silvestri. 

  Coming from ‘One Heart’ it’s great as an intro for the next song ‘Now Or Never’. Also the meaning. The whole album I’ve been mourning and moaning about losing my girl. And now it’s time to get back to the future. Get on with life."
