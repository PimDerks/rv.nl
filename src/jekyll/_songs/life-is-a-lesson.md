<p>Life is a lesson<br />
and the answer's in the end<br />
We all have a good time<br />
Or at least we will pretend<br />
Life is a lesson<br />
some of us will never learn<br />
time and time again they will return</p>

<p>We came to earth<br />
To shine our light<br />
And teach the world<br />
how they can set things right<br />
But all we learn is how to survive<br />
Inside the fishbowl of a made-up life</p>

<p>We're at the college of the Universe<br />
Come and make that bubble burst<br />
remember</p>

<p>Life is a lesson<br />
And the answer's in the end<br />
We all have a good time<br />
Or at least we will pretend<br />
Life is a lesson<br />
Some of us will never learn<br />
Time and time again they will return</p>

<p>Don't be sad<br />
No one gets out of here alive<br />
Stay aboard, life is short<br />
Don't throw it all away<br />
for something that tears you down<br />
And pulls you back again<br />
Back again</p>

<p>Life is a lesson<br />
and the answer's in the end<br />
We all have a good time<br />
Or at least we will pretend<br />
Life is a lesson<br />
some of us will never learn<br />
Then time and time again<br />
they will return</p>

<p>Life is a lesson<br />
and the answer's in the end<br />
(Answer's in the end)<br />
We all have a good time<br />
Or at least we will pretend<br />
Ooh<br />
Life is a lesson<br />
some of us will never learn Aah<br />
Time and time again they will return Yeah<br />
Time and time again they will return<br />
Oh yeah<br />
Time and time again they will return</p>
