A typical AOR mid tempo song. With harmonies in the choirs Johan and I used to do on the first album. Ever since we started to sing harmonies together when we were kids, our voices combined make a special sound. They blend very well and over the years it’s still there.
And especially in these type of tracks (+One Of these Days, Now Or Never) I need him badly.
With Noppy Ton from my old late 80’s band 1st Avenue on drums. Played live without a click track in the Fendalsound studio, recorded by Hans van Vondelen who mixed the ‘Believing Is Seeing ‘album.
