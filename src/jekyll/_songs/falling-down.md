The album opener kicks off with a vocal harmony sung in the F diminished chord, shortly noted as Fdim : The initials of the album title.
Followed by a killer metal guitar riff that swirls into a tempo-changed two note frustrated piano sequence behind the annoying sound of the voice from the answering machine, that’s been heard for the umpteenth time.
Desperation all over the place. ‘No last goodbye, no why- murdered inside ‘ , ‘Can’t breath, getting too deep’
‘All fucked up and no place to go’. The tone is set. ‘No escape I’m falling down…..’ in Misanthropolis.
