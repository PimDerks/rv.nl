title: Falling Down
year: 2007
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: |
  The album opener kicks off with a vocal harmony sung in the F diminished chord, shortly noted as Fdim : The initials of the album title. Followed by a killer metal guitar riff that swirls into a tempo-changed two note frustrated piano sequence behind the annoying sound of the voice from the answering machine, that’s been heard for the umpteenth time.

  Desperation all over the place. ‘No last goodbye, no why- murdered inside‘, ‘Can’t breath, getting too deep’, ‘All fucked up and no place to go’. The tone is set. ‘No escape I’m falling down…..’ in Misanthropolis."

<p>Sleep tight - white lie - no last goodbye<br />
What's it all to you<br />
Fogged, fried, uptight - no why<br />
Murdered inside</p>

<p>Can't breathe! Getting too deep!<br />
No sleep! Forever I bleed!<br />
Don't you see that I will die for you</p>

<p>All fucked up and no place to go<br />
Giving up hope, became a two way loser<br />
Gone my world, just for a girl<br />
Forever alone, why did I have to lose her</p>

<p>No escape I'm falling down<br />
No escape I'm falling down</p>

<p>Black hole - trapped soul<br />
Lost all control - all because of you<br />
No pride - I can't hide<br />
Denied, but still on your side<br />
Lost my heart with you</p>

<p>All wrong! Coming undone!<br />
Black rain! Going insane!<br />
No more! I give it all up to you</p>

<p>All fucked up and no place to go<br />
Giving up hope, became a two way loser<br />
Gone my world, just for a girl<br />
Forever alone, why did I have to lose her</p>

<p>No escape I'm falling down<br />
No escape I'm falling down</p>
