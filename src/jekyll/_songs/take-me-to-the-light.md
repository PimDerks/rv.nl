<p>In a vision I escaped out of my head<br />
With brand new eyes<br />
Saw myself on a stage oversized<br />
Banging black and whites<br />
Climbed the grand<br />
It's all or nothing<br />
Jumped into the sky<br />
Nothing to lose<br />
I'm calling out to You</p>

<p>Take me to the light<br />
Get me through the night<br />
I am begging you please<br />
Take me to the light<br />
Make it all right<br />
What do I have to do<br />
To make it through</p>

<p>In the vision I was all set free to fly<br />
Through space and time<br />
Stepped into another parallel life<br />
Where the world was bright<br />
with a crash woke up to nothing<br />
The bars still in my head<br />
Nothing to lose<br />
I'm calling out to you</p>

<p>Take me to the light<br />
Get me through the night<br />
I am begging you please<br />
Take me to the light<br />
Get me through the night<br />
I am begging you please<br />
Take me to the light<br />
Get me through the night<br />
Take me to the light<br />
Make it all right<br />
What do I have to do<br />
To make it through</p>

<p class="em">Solo</p>

<p>Take me to the light<br />
Get me through the night<br />
I am begging you please<br />
Take me to the light<br />
Make it alright<br />
I am begging you please<br />
Take me to the light<br />
Get me through the night<br />
I am begging you please<br />
Take me to the light<br />
Make it all right<br />
What do I have to do<br />
To get close to you</p>
