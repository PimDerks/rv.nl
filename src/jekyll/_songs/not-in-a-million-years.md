<p>Just for a while - look at the world that's around you<br />
Show me a smile - nothing on earth satisfies you</p>

<p>It's true, light is the darkness for you<br />
No one can break down the truth<br />
Holding on, holding on, holding on to...</p>

<p>Not in a million years I stay<br />
I cry a million tears each day<br />
It's hurt me too many times<br />
Not in a million years I'd change<br />
Not in a million years I stay</p>

<p>Just for a while - look at the walls that surround you<br />
This place of exile's all in your head you must break through</p>

<p>It's true, down in the dawn lies the truth<br />
Powers to make it brand new<br />
Holding on, holding on, holding on to...</p>

<p>Not in a million years I stay<br />
I cry a million tears each day<br />
It's hurt me too many times<br />
Not in a million years I'd change<br />
Not in a million years I stay</p>
