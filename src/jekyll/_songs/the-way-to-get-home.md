<p>I walk in circles with the wind in my face<br />
Everywhere I go I feel so out of place<br />
Like it's destiny<br />
I have to find myself a different way<br />
This strong depression cannot possibly stay<br />
I'm all out of tears</p>

<p>But someday, I know there'll be different times<br />
Someday, true love I will find<br />
Someway, there will be a change of tide<br />
Someday</p>

<p>These lonely nights and lonely days<br />
Will take me one step further away<br />
But I still believe (still believe)<br />
Believe in love<br />
These lonely nights and lonely days<br />
Will take me one step further away<br />
But I still believe (still believe)<br />
Where my broken soul may roam<br />
Only God knows the way to get home</p>

<p>Maybe it's just a necessary phase<br />
I have to go through to find better days<br />
Like it's destiny<br />
I think it's time to stop running away<br />
To all iniquity that led me astray<br />
Could you answer me?</p>

<p>But someday, I know there'll be different times<br />
Someday, true love I will find<br />
Someway, there will be a change of tide<br />
Someday</p>

<p>These lonely nights and lonely days<br />
Will take me one step further away<br />
But I still believe (still believe)<br />
Believe in love<br />
These lonely nights and lonely days<br />
Will take me one step further away<br />
But I still believe (still believe)<br />
Where my broken soul may roam<br />
Only God knows the way to get home</p>

<p>I reach out for the spirit of hope, who can tell<br />
Rely on the voice inside I know so well<br />
I got to break free<br />
I won't let this thing get me down</p>

<p>But someday, I know there'll be different times<br />
Someday, true love I will find<br />
Someway, there will be a change of tide<br />
Someday</p>

<p>These lonely nights and lonely days<br />
Will take me one step further away<br />
But I still believe (still believe)<br />
Believe in love<br />
These lonely nights and lonely days<br />
Will take me one step further away<br />
But I still believe (still believe)<br />
Where my broken soul may roam<br />
Only God knows the way to get home</p>
