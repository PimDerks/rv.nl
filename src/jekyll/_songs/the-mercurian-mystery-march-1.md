<p>In the beginning, a sun and two moons in the sky<br />
Mercurian orbit swinging, the polar lights on the equator sing</p>

<p>La la la la la la la in the beginning</p>

<p>This was not the first time the wheel was invented <br />
there were men before the apeman<br />
(Alei-alei ova coua, alei-alei ova coua)<br />
They came from the sky sowing seeds on the world<br />
breeding many kinds of races<br />
(Alei-alei ova coua, alei-alei ova coua)</p>

<p>They built Atlantic cities<br />
they educated living<br />
We threw rocks at the moons in the sky<br />
We grew wiser as the ages flew by<br />
The knowledge made us greedy<br />
The first end of the world</p>

<p>Stairway of human evolution ending with a<br />
Nuclear breeze - Big Bang by the atom beam<br />
Nuclear breeze - Black bite in the cerulean<br />
Fratricide genealogy<br />
We're reviving the history<br />
The Mercurian Mystery</p>

<p>People of the past being barbarian<br />
today remain the same unless they start becoming egalitarian</p>

<p>The lineage of the race after apocalypse will survive for many eons...</p>
