about: |
  The stranger in the midst. 80â€™s electro-pop sounding track with catchy sing along pop/rock chorus. Sung with low -tongue in cheek- lead vocals customary for these type of songs. A fun track that escapes the dark atmosphere of the majority of the songs on this album. Synthesized-basses, pounding bass drum, danceable rhythm, the patently obvious gay-pastiche puts a smile on your face.
