<p>Gonna move, gonna groove, gonna get up to the roof<br />
    'Cause tonight it's gonna come off<br />
    Wanna blaze, wanna daze, climb a rocket into space<br />
    Gimme something that turns me on</p>

<p>Bet you gonna like it instead of staying home straight to bed<br />
    We're gonna party from dusk till dawn</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>We got the groove, we kill the grind<br />
    We're gonna loose ourselves tonight lose?<br />
    We got to move into a perfect state of mind<br />
    We got to dance, get in a trance<br />
    And celebrate this true romance<br />
    Tonight's the night we're gonna put this world behind<br />
    One step closer to the light</p>

<p>Feel the beat, watch the crowd, here the freaks are hanging out<br />
    It's a shackadelic crazy bash<br />
    Get some E, get aroused, get some action in the house<br />
    But my sister didn't bring her stash</p>

<p>Candy from the light-jacket man, you're gonna like it she said<br />
    It keeps you under from dusk till dawn</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus)</p>

<p class="em">(Solo)</p>

<p>Just a little touch<br />
    Just a little push<br />
    Just a little...<br />
    It ain't that complicated</p>

<p>Just a little touch<br />
    Just a little push<br />
    Just a little...<br />
    It ain't that complicated</p>

<p>Hey you!<br />
    Gather round<br />
    We got the moves and we're showing you how<br />
    Nothing's gonna stop us, no one's gonna stop us now</p>

<p>Hey you!<br />
    Gather round<br />
    We got the groove and we're showing you how<br />
    Nothing's gonna stop us, no one's gonna stop us now<br />
    Nothing's gonna stop us now</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus)</p>
