about: "Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir was the inspiration for the verses. The beat especially.
It’s a divers track, with a small piano-concert intermezzo, an up-tempo chorus and a boogie middle part that turns out into a heavy-metal beat. Some ‘The Sweet ‘- like choirs done with the help of Johan Willems in the chorus. I couldn’t get a good drum sound when mixing it. Arjen Lucassen helped me out by mixing the song in his studio. It’s about getting alienated. Becoming a misanthrope while trying to get the spirit and hope up in times of huge insecurity and desperation."

<p>I, I'm Supernova I can fly<br />
I put the rainbow in the sky<br />
In this place of superstition<br />
Time is traveling with the speed of light<br />
Temptation-quest I must defy<br />
All that trash and fake religion</p>

<p>See the mass-parades here from the sky<br />
All those mindless sheep they don't know why<br />
Why do they cry?</p>

<p>This is Misanthropia - solitary euphoria<br />
In these times where fools will win the war<br />
Tell me what's real, when you must conceal<br />
All your beliefs in life</p>

<p>I - I can't give up without a fight<br />
There's no excuse but I'm so tired<br />
Of this world of great confusion<br />
I - I'm Supernova 'till I die<br />
I use my tears as ink to write 'bout the pain of disillusion</p>

<p>Fear the masquerade, it runs your sight<br />
All that red and black light shine so bright<br />
Bewitching your eyes</p>

<p>This is Misanthrophia - it's just me, myself and I<br />
In these times where fools will win the war<br />
Tell me what's real, when you must conceal<br />
All your beliefs in life</p>

<p>It's just begun!</p>
