composer: Robby Valentine
about: "Led Zeppelin’s Kashmir was the inspiration for the verses. The beat especially.
It’s a divers track, with a small piano-concert intermezzo, an up-tempo chorus and a boogie middle part that turns out into a heavy-metal beat. Some ‘The Sweet ‘- like choirs done with the help of Johan Willems in the chorus’. I couldn’t get a good drum sound when mixing it. Arjen Lucassen helped me out by mixing the song in his studio.
It’s about getting alienated. Becoming a misanthrope while trying to get the spirit and hope up in times of huge insecurity and desperation."
