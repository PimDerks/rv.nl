<p>Like brother and sister<br />
Black Sean and white Sue<br />
Two kids in friendship so true<br />
But daddy main mister said<br />
It had to be through<br />
Because her friend ain't no good</p>

<p>Why don't her buddy qualify<br />
Oh she doesn't understand<br />
The hate in daddy's eyes<br />
She doesn't care - world<br />
If he's yellow - black or white<br />
Her only hope<br />
Is her wish deep inside</p>

<p>Santa is coming<br />
Through spaces of war<br />
Bringing the present<br />
We're all waiting for<br />
Love and believing<br />
Will knock on our door<br />
Giving us people<br />
A much better world<br />
He's our only friend<br />
He's megaman</p>

<p>Hey suckers of system<br />
I'm talking to you<br />
Why don't you see what you do<br />
You tell your children<br />
Being different ain't good<br />
What is this curse on you</p>

<p>Why are you spreading<br />
All these lies<br />
Is it just another war<br />
Inside you can't defy<br />
I'm telling you - world<br />
Can you open up your eyes<br />
Why can't you be<br />
Like you're at Christmas time</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Santa is coming<br />
Through spaces of war<br />
Bringing the present<br />
We're all waiting for<br />
Love and believing<br />
Will knock on our door<br />
Giving us people<br />
A much better world<br />
He's our only friend<br />
He's our only friend<br />
He's our only friend<br />
Our only friend<br />
Try to understand<br />
We're megamen</p>
