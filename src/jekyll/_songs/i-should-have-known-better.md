about: |
  This is one of the pop-metal songs of the album. Like ‘New World’. A bit of nu-metal combined with clear harmonies/melodies and song structure. For months and months I was waiting for my girl to come back to me. We were, as I thought, temporary separated. Living 2000 km apart.

  As a result of this waiting I hardly worked or wrote anything. It felt my life was on hold and would start again once she would return. At one point I realized she didn’t have the intention to come back to me after all.

  Big desperation and knowing deep down inside that it was over made me start recording and writing again. It was the only way for me to get through, to put my emotions into songs, as a safe haven to deal with the pain of losing her and to deal with the fading hope. Making music was the only way not to go insane completely. In this song I can hear I still have hope, but being very upset.

<p>They say I'm crazy that I still got my faith in you<br />
Don't tell me "maybe"<br />
Now you've made me become unglued<br />
You keep me waiting<br />
While you're breaking my heart in two</p>

<p>Hey, Hey! Honey I would give my life for you<br />
Said you wanted me to marry you<br />
I gave you my world, a heaven on earth<br />
But you threw it all away<br />
So what's keeping you to say we're through</p>

<p>Don't, don't you fake me<br />
Now you made me too blind to see<br />
I must be crazy just to think we were meant to be<br />
Babe, I'm still waiting, masturbating on thoughts of you</p>

<p>Hey, Hey! Baby I would never lie to you<br />
Thought you wanted me to marry you<br />
I gave you my world, a heaven on earth<br />
You threw it all away<br />
But still you cannot say we're through</p>

<p>I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better to trust a woman again<br />
I should've known better! I should've known better! </p>

<p>Hey! Mean Master Race!</p>
