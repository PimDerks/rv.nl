<p>Light years from these mountains to the stars<br />
Shows us what we aim for, who we are<br />
To settle for our weaknesses<br />
Or try to push our faith immensely far</p>

<p>The beauty of the heart<br />
Reminds us who we are<br />
Show the way to the truth</p>

<p>We were invincible<br />
We were inseparable<br />
And I know I'll find the answer to make us one again<br />
We were invincible<br />
We were invincible</p>

<p>Light years on the highway to the stars<br />
The one escape that leads back to your heart<br />
It's somewhere in the universe<br />
The love we lost, I must find back our world<br />
What tore us all apart, the dark side of the heart<br />
But I can't give up, in the name of love</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Tear will come and go and push us back so far<br />
But may we not forget the way we were is the way we are</p>

<p>We are invincible, we are unconquerable<br />
And I know I'll find an answer to make us one again<br />
We are invincible, we are unconquerable<br />
And I know out there's the answer to make us one again<br />
We were invincible, we're now invisible<br />
We were invincible</p>
