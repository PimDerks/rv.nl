<p>I throw a stick off a cliff, tie him to a tree<br /> 
But it don't work - but it don't work <br />
Chocolate bars in his food, 
    shot to sleep for good <br />
But it don't work - No, it don't work <br />
He's sneaking up from behind<br />
Taking over my life</p>

<p>He growls and he shows his teeth, 
   when I try to leave <br />
So I don't dare - No, I don't dare <br />
When my friend's at the door - 
   he blows up by four <br />
So they don't dare - No, they don't dare <br />
He's creeping into my mind - 
   He's the deadliest kind<br />
Yeah he makes me mentally blind - 
   Come on...</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>
Black dog get out of my head<br />
Get lost, you're driving me mad<br />
Take a hike - Hoooh<br />
On the tracks if you like - Hoooh - 
   Come on... <br />
Black dog get out of my head<br />
Get lost, I wish you were dead<br />
Take a bite - Hoooh - 
   On some lit dynamite - Hooo</p>

<p>Then sometimes when he's floored - 
   I sneak out the door<br /> 
But it don't work - No, it don't work <br />
On every corner and street 
    he shows up at my feet <br />
Oh it don't work<br />
And then he barks and he bites - 
   Pushing me back inside<br />
Close the curtains, turn off the lights - Come on...</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Guitar solo</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Black dog get out of my head<br />
Get lost, you're driving me mad<br />
Take a hike - Hoooh - On the tracks if 
   you like - Hoooh - Come on...<br />
Black Dog get out of my head  - 
Drink from a toilet instead <br />
Take a hike - Hoooh - On the tracks if 
   you like - Hoooh - Come on... 
Black dog get out of my head <br />
Get lost, I wish you were dead<br />
Take a bite - Hoooh - 
   On some lit dynamite - Hooooh</p>

<p>I throw a stick off a cliff<br />
Tie him to a tree <br />
But it don't work...</p>
