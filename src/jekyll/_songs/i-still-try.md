<p>I don't know what time it is but I got to get to you<br />
Well many years have past us by, I ain't got no time to lose</p>

<p>But I still try,<br />
I still try,<br />
I still build my walls around</p>

<p>I still try,<br />
I still try,<br />
Though it always bring me down</p>

<p>I still try, I still try, I still try...</p>

<p>Well I don't know what's been going on while I live my life for you<br />
and things have changed since you've been gone but I can't get over you</p>

<p>But I still try,<br />
I still try,<br />
I still build my walls around</p>

<p>I still try,<br />
I still try,<br />
Though it always bring me down</p>

<p>I still try, I still try, I still try...</p>

<p>I just wouldn't listen<br />
To all the things you do<br />
I know I shouldn't miss ya<br />
'cause</p>

<p>Any ol' way you<br />
Any ol' way I lose</p>

<p>But I still try,<br />
I still try,<br />
I still build my walls around</p>

<p>I still try,<br />
I still try,<br />
Though it always bring me down</p>

<p>I still try, I still try, I still try...</p>
