<p>You're pulling me up, you're pushing me down<br />
    Down down to the ground<br />
    You're pulling me up, you're pushing me down<br />
    Down down to the ground</p>

<p>She turned around and said to me:<br />
    I've seen a world you've never seen<br />
    You'd be astound of what you'd see<br />
    I got the key, just follow me</p>

<p>Such another time, such another place behind the door<br />
    But once you know you won't let go</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>You're pulling me up, you're pushing me down<br />
    Down down to the ground<br />
    You're pulling me up, you're pushing me down<br />
    Down down to the ground</p>

<p>She turned around and stared at me<br />
    Into a face she's never seen<br />
    'Cause all that's left inside of me<br />
    A shadow of the one I used to be</p>

<p>Hit another high, yet another low, worse than before<br />
    But now I know, I can't let go</p>

<p>You're pulling me up, you're pushing me down<br />
    Down down to the ground<br />
    You're pulling me up, you're pushing me down<br />
    Down down to the ground<br />
    You're tearing me down</p>

<p>She turned around and said to me:<br />
    I know a place you've never seen</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus x 2)</p>

<p>You're tearing me down<br />
    You're tearing me down<br />
    You're tearing me down</p>
