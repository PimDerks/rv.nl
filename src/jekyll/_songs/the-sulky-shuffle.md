<p>Wherever I go feel alone<br />
Wherever I do 'm on my own<br />
Like it should last forever and ever<br />
So many chances have gone by<br />
All by the cause of being too shy<br />
I don't wanna be lonely forever<br />
I'd like to go back all the way<br />
And do it right in every way<br />
I'm sure I would do whatever I'd like</p>

<p>Father Almighty from above<br />
Make me forget this broken love<br />
I can't spend my life crying forever - and ever<br />
I can't keep on mourning every day<br />
I pray for love that's here to stay<br />
Tell me what's right, show me the light, show me the light</p>

<p>Hold on, hold on<br />
Gotta ta ta be alright - I give it all<br />
Hold on, Hold on<br />
Gotta ta ta take some time<br />
Till you're out of my mind</p>

<p>Whenever I thought I'd seen the light<br />
A blessing for always being upright<br />
How could I think it would be forever - and ever<br />
I'd like to take this blues away<br />
And stop reviving yesterday<br />
Save me tonight, show me the light, show me the light</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Till you can suck my mind<br />
(You're out of my mind)</p>

<p>But why can't you see<br />
There's more in life than living for a dream<br />
I know that it's true<br />
But I can't keep my mind away from you</p>

<p>Chorus x 2</p>
