<p>Sometimes it seems this road leads to love<br />
Then you wake up, your dearest's gone<br />
You don't know what is coming down on you<br />
What is happening to me</p>

<p>In the arms of loneliness<br />
Where can I go<br />
In the arms of loneliness<br />
I'd die without a home<br />
Can't you see what it did to me<br />
In the arms of loneliness I'm meant to be</p>
