<p>People say I'm dreaming, dreaming of the past<br />
But I'm only searching for something to last<br />
In this world of changes my hope has gone offshore<br />
Someboy tell me what have I been living for</p>

<p>Don't take away the thing that's keeping me alive<br />
Don't waste the only chance of reaching the light</p>

<p>It's a winding road, destiny takes me through<br />
It's a winding road, the way that I had to choose<br />
But I can't let go, I know, that everywhere I go<br />
You guide me through this winding road</p>

<p>People keep abandoning, abandoning the truth<br />
How they once were feeling in the wonders of our youth<br />
But I can't believe that a heart can turn me to stone<br />
Somebody help me, tell me that I'm not alone</p>

<p>Don't hide the love, don't the keep the beauty deep inside<br />
Don't waste the only chance of reaching the light</p>

<p>It's a winding road, destiny takes me through<br />
It's a winding road, the way that I have to choose<br />
But I can't let go, I know, that everywhere I go<br />
You guide me through this winding road</p>

<p>It's a winding road, destiny takes me through<br />
It's a winding road, the way that I have to choose<br />
But I can't let go, I know, that everywhere I go<br />
You guide me through this winding road<br />
Guide me through this winding road</p>
