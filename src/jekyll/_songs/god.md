<p>Now my time is near<br />
My lord I fear<br />
I've come to you<br />
Forever alone till the end</p>

<p>God, is it true that love is just a waste of time<br />
Is it true that life's a song so hard to put in rhyme?<br />
Yes You gave me time to see<br />
My life go by<br />
Oh how I feared<br />
Oh how I cried<br />
But now the time seems near<br />
You whispered words I couldn't fail to hear</p>

<p>God, is it true that love is not a waste of time<br />
Is it true that someday I can sing my life in rhyme<br />
Can't You give me time to seek<br />
The hidden sign<br />
I truly feel<br />
I know I will find<br />
But Lord time and time again<br />
I fall short in the end<br />
I'm just a note away</p>

<p>Please tell me where You are<br />
I'm just a searcher for a shooting star<br />
Left in the cold<br />
This made-in-heaven soul wasn't there at all</p>

<p>My master from afar<br />
I'm a believer with a sacred heart<br />
How was I to know<br />
Medusa took control<br />
And I almost lost my soul</p>

<p>Shof kulla shaai timshi birahamaati

<p>Let me be</p>

<p>Laazim taarif innak mukhtaar</p>

<p>Make me see</p>

<p>More than mortal minds can feel<br />
Please don't lose your faith in me</p>

<p>I'm on the run<br />
See what the twisted and misted have done<br />
I went a million miles astray<br />
I don't belong - where all the magic and justice is gone<br />
Give me the answer, just give me a chance now<br />
I ask you, I beg you<br />
Read the alabaster<br />
Get rid of the cauchemar, Ra</p>

<p>God, now I know that love is not a waste of time<br />
but I still can't find the key to set my life in rhyme<br />
oh, I'm just a note away</p>

<p>Please tell me where You are<br />
I'm just a searcher for a shooting star<br />
Left in the cold<br />
This made-in-heaven soul wasn't there at all</p>

<p>My saviour from afar<br />
I'm a believer with a sacred heart<br />
How was I to know<br />
Medusa took control<br />
And I almost lost my soul</p>
