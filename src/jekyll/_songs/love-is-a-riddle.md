<p>Tell me are you happy now<br />
Have you met your dream<br />
somehow<br />
I even try,<br />
even try...</p>

<p>To forget the fairy-tale<br />
guess that's what we have to stay<br />
believe I try<br />
believe I try</p>

<p>Love is a riddle<br />
Love is a riddle<br />
Love is a riddle</p>

<p>You are my only friend<br />
Love is a riddle<br />
Love is a riddle<br />
Love is a riddle</p>

<p>You & Me...</p>
