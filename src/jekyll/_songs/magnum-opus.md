about: |
  An ode to Magnum ice cream. In the past I wrote some long and epical tracks . I was asked frequently to record more of these rock opera type of songs. Being fed up with recording long tracks and with that question I called this short song ‘Magnum opus’ . The title suggests a big rock opera or something like it, while it’s just a silly 60’s type of song. It looks like it’s about a girl but in the end it turns out to be about Magnum Ice-cream.

  Maybe they can adopt it in a commercial . That would be a dream, full circle. It surely would be a little payback for all the money I spent on them through the years. I did some guitar harmonies with the Brian May guitar on it. And my favourite drummer Juan plays the drums.

<p>I walk down the street gonna buy something sweet<br />
Guess some sugar might hear<br />
Just for an hour or a minute or two<br />
Change the way that I feel</p>

<p>I had to be alone to get into the special zone<br />
But now I feel undone<br />
Just because I'm overdoses doesn't mean I'm bored<br />
with my baby</p>

<p>What would I do in a world without you<br />
You save my life<br />
Whenever I'm lost, you're guiding me all the way<br />
What would I do when I can't count on you<br />
within my life<br />
All that I say<br />
A magnum for everyday!</p>
