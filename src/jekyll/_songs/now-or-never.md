An up beat up-tempo rock song with a slice of bombast.
Positive lyrics for a change : “Yesterday’s gone forever, live your life it’s now or never”.
The whole song’s very much inspired by Brian May’s ‘Back to The Light’ period.
With Johan again joining me in the harmonies and singing the lead in the bridges.
