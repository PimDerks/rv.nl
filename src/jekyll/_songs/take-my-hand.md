<p>Wish I were in the little boys dream<br />
Where the soul is pure and the mind is green<br />
But the times have changed now I don't know where to go<br />
Love - gold - money<br />
I still dream of what I used to dream<br />
But the world today is a different scene<br />
But I just can't change so I think it's time to go<br />
Stop - No</p>

<p>Years I fought like a noble knight<br />
Tried to win for us all (to glorify)<br />
Still I'm fighting this lonesome fight<br />
Why don't you let me die</p>

<p>Nobody listens to a man without a gun<br />
No one will see me through, seems useless what I've done<br />
I keep falling from the sky<br />
My life had just begun</p>

<p>Life's a stage in a wicked fool's dream<br />
Where the madman rules and the witch is queen<br />
And there's just one way for the mortal minds to go<br />
Greed - gold - money<br />
I still care 'bout our destiny<br />
Gotta make a change and create a dream<br />
Gotta tell 'em all about the great big world above<br />
Love - go</p>

<p>Fears will guide the wrong desire<br />
Fight your way to the dawn (you must be strong)<br />
Free your mind and relight your fire<br />
Drive away the wrong</p>

<p>Take my hand and sanctify<br />
Ask for salvation and pray<br />
Take my hand and glorify<br />
Love is just a heartbeat away</p>

<p>Wish I were in the little boys dream<br />
Where the soul is pure and the mind is green<br />
Where the ga-ga-minded fossil-headed freaks<br />
are dead and gone</p>

<p>Take my hand and sanctify<br />
Ask for love and pride<br />
Take my hand and glorify<br />
Heaven is the only guide</p>
