<p>Eyes in the mirror made me try to see<br />
Things that take the pride away<br />
Life, such a beautiful delight, did pass me all the way</p>

<p>Like it's so hard to get in harmony<br />
Think it's just the price to pay<br />
Life I wanted to deny but I need it anyway</p>

<p>I give my heart and soul to reach the highest star<br />
I'm shifting all my goals and try to get that far</p>

<p>What can I do, what can I say<br />
I cannot fly away<br />
The doubt inside ain't gonna change my mind<br />
'Cause I still can't quit the game</p>

<p>Life in the mirror made me hide and seek<br />
Where's the true delight of day<br />
Life I wanted to deny but I need it anyway<br />
I need it anyway, I need it anyway</p>
