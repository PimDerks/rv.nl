about: "
Pushy, annoying and a little modern.
Being a little pissed off by the fact songwriter Linda Perry obviously listened a little too well to the verses of his song “What In The World I’m Waiting For” from the 2000 released Valentine album ‘Believing Is Seeing’ for Gwen Stefanie’s solo debut single : “What You Waiting For” , RV wrote this track to show his dissatisfaction .
But there’s more to the song of course. It’s about knowing who you are and what you stand for.
Nice part is when the song gets into a more aggressive stage at 1:48 min. The threatening builds up, then shouts….. “I don’t bow for a humanoid !!!!”
Lots of frustrations are coming out . Frustrations about society and about how pure souls are being deformed, or let themselves being deformed .
Frustrations about how so many deny their own unpopular goals and being."
