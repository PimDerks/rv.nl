title: Show Your Face
year: 2007
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: "
Pushy, annoying and a little modern.
Being a little pissed off by the fact songwriter Linda Perry obviously listened a little too well to the verses of his song “What In The World I’m Waiting For” from the 2000 released Valentine album ‘Believing Is Seeing’ for Gwen Stefanie’s solo debut single : “What You Waiting For” , RV wrote this track to show his dissatisfaction .
But there’s more to the song of course. It’s about knowing who you are and what you stand for.
Nice part is when the song gets into a more aggressive stage at 1:48 min. The threatening builds up, then shouts….. “I don’t bow for a humanoid !!!!”
Lots of frustrations are coming out . Frustrations about society and about how pure souls are being deformed, or let themselves being deformed .
Frustrations about how so many deny their own unpopular goals and being."

<p>You want the big screen - you want a fast car<br />
But every time in vain you try<br />
To write a hit song - become a rock star<br />
Relentlessly the years go by<br />
I love you - I hate you<br />
I'll take it all anyway you want to<br />
I'll help you, stand by you<br />
But now it's time you're gonna get through</p>

<p>(And) Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face now!<br />
Left-right! Hey! Left-Right! Hey!<br />
Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face!</p>

<p>I watch the big screen, it's Gwen Stefani<br />
With Linda Perry's song this time<br />
Oh now I know how Bobby McFerrin feels<br />
Return the favour in the chorus line<br />
Don't worry, I ain't happy<br />
But don't let it stop your jeer upon me<br />
So hate me, deny me<br />
Go chase the herd you follow blindly!</p>

<p>I don't bow for a humanoid<br />
I don't bow for a humanoid<br />
I don't. I don't. I don't bow for a humanoid. I don't bow.<br />
I wish 'em all dead. Hey dead. Hey dead. Hey dead. Hey<br />
Hey hey hey hey hey hey<br />
Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face - show your face<br />
Show your face</p>
