<p>He's getting the ball and he's passing 
   a man and another<br /> 
He's aiming - he's taking a shot - It's a GOAL!</p>

<p>Hey you, with the pretty face<br />
You got a lot to learn and no time to waste<br />
Look out! For the man in dress<br />
I bet he's got a little something taped 
   upon his chest</p>

<p>Soon or late we all go down down down down<br />
So let's wake up - get your feet on the ground</p>

<p>Get lost with your peace-parade<br />
They don't give a fuck: the serpents in the shade<br />
Look out! Yeah, you should be scared<br />
You gotta be prepared - the danger's everywhere</p>

<p>Pretty soon we're going down down down down<br />
So let's wake up - we can turn this around</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>We are the sons of America<br />
Through the fire and the rain<br />
We are fighting for the same<br />
We are the sons of America<br />
We're defending our right to be free</p>

<p>Look out! He's got a hand grenade<br />
You better shoot to kill and don't hesitate<br />
Hey you! With the slide trombone<br />
Get your trumpet friends and bring the saxophone</p>

<p>'Cause we need that wicked sound 
    sound sound sound<br />
To wake up and to take 'em all down</p>

<p class="em">Brass solo</p>

<p>One by one they're going down down down down<br />
Come join the band - we can turn this around</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>We are the sons of America<br />
Through the fire and the rain<br />
We are fighting for the same<br />
We are the sons of America<br />
We're defending our right to be free</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>With our heads under the ground fast asleep</p>
