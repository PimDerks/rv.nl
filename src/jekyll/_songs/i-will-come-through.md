<p>All my life<br />
I've been searching for my Valentine<br />
I'e been waiting for some peace of mind<br />
to guide me through</p>

<p>Lost in time<br />
Oh I almost crossed the borderline<br />
But the love I though I'd never find<br />
I found in you</p>

<p>Life on earth seemed just a terrible phase<br />
But now I clearly see the light through the haze</p>

<p>Whenever I reach the sky<br />
Whenever my dreams are high<br />
Where ever I'm going to<br />
I'll be back again<br />
Whenever the sun won't shine<br />
Whenever this world will lie<br />
Whatever they say<br />
Whatever they do<br />
I will come through</p>

<p>Mesmerized<br />
by a vision seen through children's eyes<br />
How I chased it without compromise<br />
Still I would lose</p>

<p>All my life<br />
was a solitary sacrifice<br />
How the world had brought me down to size<br />
And killed my view</p>

<p>But I'm convinced the disillusion will end<br />
And all the magic times will come back again</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Chorus</p>
