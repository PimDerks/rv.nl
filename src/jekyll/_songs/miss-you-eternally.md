<p>I woke up a million miles away<br />
All that I remember<br />
We broke up yesterday<br />
Where is all the love<br />
The promise we made<br />
I can't believe how it all fades away</p>

<p>I don't know<br />
I just don't know what to do<br />
Girl I never can<br />
No I can't stop loving you<br />
Tell me what is wrong<br />
Please recall your faith<br />
Don't tell me it's too late</p>

<p>Darling I miss you<br />
Every single day<br />
I feel so lost in this world<br />
I can never face a life without you<br />
Fantasize that you return to me<br />
But for now it's only a dream</p>

<p>Time passed by - I found another love<br />
In dreams I might forget you<br />
But for real it seems so tough<br />
Oh yes I'm trying hard<br />
To leave the past behind<br />
But I can't help that<br />
It's still burning inside</p>

<p>Oh I don't know<br />
I really don't know what to do<br />
I just can't live<br />
With this heartache about you<br />
Just another chance<br />
Is everything I need<br />
Forgive me how I feel</p>

<p>Darling I miss you<br />
Every night and day<br />
I feel so lost in this world<br />
I can never face a life without you<br />
Fantasize you still belong to me<br />
'Cause you are still<br />
The answer to my dream</p>

<p>I wonder what is going on<br />
I wonder how you feel<br />
Tell me are you happy now<br />
And never think of me<br />
Caused another broken heart<br />
Or closed another door<br />
You're on the run forever more</p>

<p>Darling I miss you<br />
Every single day<br />
I feel so lost in this world<br />
I can never face a life without you<br />
Fantasize that you return to me</p>

<p>Oh darling I miss you (miss you so)<br />
Oh every night and day<br />
I feel so lost in this world<br />
I can never face a life without you<br />
Fantasize that you return to me<br />
But for now it's only a dream</p>
