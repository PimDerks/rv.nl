<p>I feel my heartbeat beat beat<br />
beating alarm<br />
Don't you take that jab jab<br />
jab in your arm<br />
It's a danger like no other<br />
Don't you let them fuck fuck<br />
fuck with your brain<br />
It's a cult so sick sick<br />
sick and insane<br />
Coming from the cosmic gutter</p>

<p>They even got inside your family's mind<br />
And all your frightened friends 
    will leave you behind<br />
But we will never fall in line</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Stay strong, you are not alone<br />
Keep your head above the waves<br />
don't become a slave<br />
It's a hard fight<br />
But you're alright<br />
They're just scared of what we hold inside<br />
The power of the light</p>

<p>Hear the clock tick tick tick<br />
ticking away<br />
And the flock gets big big<br />
bigger each day<br />
In a trance led to the slaughter<br />
In a rush, rush, rush<br />
they're playing Russian roulette<br />
It's a scam, hush, hush<br />
played over your head<br />
They're out to get your sons and daughters</p>

<p>They divide the world with scandalous lies<br />
Demonizing those who fight for our rights<br />
But we will never fall in line</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>While they keep violating<br />
all human rights<br />
We'll never waver<br />
never give up the fight<br />
'Cause we will never fall in line</p>

<p>Stay strong<br />
You are not alone<br />
Keep your head above the waves<br />
Don't become a slave<br />
It's a hard fight<br />
But you're alright<br />
Just be proud of who you are<br />
Be a superstar</p>

<p>You just stay strong<br />
You are not alone<br />
Keep your head above the waves<br />
Don't become a slave<br />
It's a hard fight<br />
But you're alright<br />
Theyâ€™re just scared of what we hold inside<br />
(Hold inside)<br />
The power of the light</p>
