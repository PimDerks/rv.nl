title: 4th Rate Razorback
order: false
year: 2007
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: |
  Marilyn Manson meets The Beach Boys! Fist raising , aggressive, metal guitar oriented track that bangs its way through the verses and finds itself falling into the sweet melody and chords of the chorus. Rather contradicting in style but works marvellously well. One of the highlights of the album.

<p>Looking for some action - in a red hell-hole<br />
T&A attraction, but I can't pay anymore<br />
I know I'm such a fourth rate razorback<br />
I know I'm walking straight into hell</p>

<p>Kickin' in emotion - wanna settle the score<br />
With sickening devotion - to some fat assed whore<br />
I know I'm at a crossroad, painted black<br />
I know I gotta get to the core</p>

<p>All we want is all we had<br />
Don't know what we got until it's gone<br />
Keeping us from moving on<br />
Here I go alone again<br />
Gets me closer to the danger zone<br />
Seems there ain't no way back home<br />
It's a bitter remorse</p>

<p>Looking for some action in this red hell-hole (I can't get no...)<br />
Can't get no satisfaction from a fuck without soul<br />
I know I'm gonna have to face the facts<br />
I know I'm walking straight into hell</p>

<p>All we want is all we had<br />
Don't know what we got until it's gone<br />
Keeping us from moving on<br />
Here I go alone again<br />
Gets me closer to the danger zone<br />
Seems there ain't no way back home<br />
It's a bitter remorse</p>

<p>Pick up the phone now - tell me you love me<br />
This is unbearable, I need a fucking answer<br />
Pick up the phone now - tell me you hate me<br />
This is unbearable, I need a fucking answer now<br />
I'll get a black suit - if that is what you want me to<br />
Anything, anything, anything for you</p>

<p>All we want is all we had<br />
Don't know what we got until it's gone<br />
Keeping us from moving on<br />
Here I go alone again<br />
Gets me closer to the danger zone<br />
Seems there ain't no way back home</p>

<p>Gotta learn from our mistakes<br />
Forgive ourselves - and try to keep the faith<br />
Move away the shade - hoping that it's not too late</p>
