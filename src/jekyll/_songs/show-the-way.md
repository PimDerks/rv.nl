<p>Know the way, don't look in their eyes<br />
Go your way, be deaf to their lies<br />
Show the way<br />
Down the river</p>

<p>Hold the flame you're keeping inside<br />
Praise your name, it's God given light<br />
Stay the same<br />
Make 'em shiver</p>

<p>Don't just chase a worldly fantasy<br />
It won't bring you to the light</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Don't get lost in the psycho stream<br />
Keep your faith in the voice within<br />
Don't adjust to the world you're in<br />
Find your truth, there's a war to win<br />
Show the way<br />
Show the way</p>

<p>Psychopaths, don't look in their eyes<br />
The walking dead,<br />
don't look in their eyes<br />
Snakes and rats, let 'em slither<br />
Go your way, don't look in their eyes<br />
Your own way, be deaf for their lies<br />
All the way down the river</p>

<p>Don't get fooled by friends or enemies<br />
Only you can find the light</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>Through the fog<br />
Through the rain<br />
You're the torch<br />
Lead the way</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>Don't get lost in the psycho stream<br />
In the psycho stream<br />
Keep your faith in the voice within<br />
To the voice within<br />
Don't ajust to the world you're in<br />
It's just the world you're in<br />
Find your truth there's a war to win</p>

<p>Show the way<br />
Show the way<br />
Show the way<br />
Show the way</p>
