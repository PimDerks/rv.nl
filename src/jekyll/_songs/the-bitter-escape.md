title: The Bitter Escape
year: 2007
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: "An inconspicuous mix of different styles in one song. Indian music inspired rock in the bridges, nu metal verses, 90â€™s Britpop melody style choruses.
A bad case of falling down in Misanthropolis."

<p>Gonna get - gonna get - get - get it down tonight<br />
But I can't - but I can't - can't - I can't win this fight<br />
This freaking inner way between wrong an right</p>

<p>A wanna be - a wanna be - that's what I am these days<br />
I can't breath - I can't feel<br />
How am I gonna get through this phase<br />
I'm such a loser, making my life a lie</p>

<p>Under the bright stars I step into my car<br />
A desperate search for something<br />
to fill the void</p>

<p>Run away into the night<br />
Couldn't make the extra mile<br />
Gone astray, again I lose control<br />
I am falling down again<br />
Got my heart for sale or rent<br />
If I go on this way I'll lose it all</p>

<p>Gonna get - gonna get - get - get it down tonight<br />
But I can't - but I can't - can't<br />
Can't turn the wrong into right<br />
Standing on the edge, I'm breaking down</p>

<p>Under the dark sky I live another lie<br />
Behind windows nothing can fill the void</p>

<p>Run away into the night<br />
Couldn't make the extra mile<br />
Gone astray, again I lose control<br />
I am falling down again<br />
Got my heart for sale or rent<br />
If I go on this way I'll lose it all</p>

<p>Do you want me to pursue this, the bitter escape<br />
A source of inspiration but way too much to take</p>

<p>Run away into the night<br />
Couldn't make the extra mile<br />
Gone astray, again I lose control<br />
I am falling down again<br />
Got my heart for sale or rent<br />
If I go on this way I'll lose it all</p>
