<p>I tried to call you on the phone<br />
last night was all I was waiting for<br />
so darlin' I want more</p>

<p>Anything I want<br />
Anything I need<br />
Anything you want from me I'll do</p>

<p>But there was you, you, you<br />
Open up the door<br />
There was you, you, you<br />
Shining like before<br />
There was you, you, you</p>

<p>I tried to make it on my own
But all I did was wrong
I'd die for you - I will for sure
It's you that I adore</p>

<p>Anything I want<br />
Anything I need<br />
Anything you want from me I'll do</p>

<p>But I want you, you, you<br />
like no one before<br />
I want you, you, you<br />
Anytime,<br />
Anytime at all</p>

<p>But there was you, you, you<br />
Open up the door<br />
There was you, you, you<br />
Shining like before<br />
There was you, you, you</p>
