<p>I should have been a father,<br />
Like my father was to me<br />
A driver and a roadie<br />
Who fulfilled my every need<br />
I should have been a husband<br />
One you can depend upon<br />
But I'm helpless like a baby<br />
Now the clouds have blocked my sun</p>

<p>A burnt down bridge<br />
No way to return<br />
Embrace this gift of lessons to learn</p>

<p>But tell me why<br />
why is this happening to me<br />
Why did my world disappear<br />
I can't let go<br />
I can't let go<br />
But I must let go</p>

<p>I should have been an angel<br />
But a demon haunts inside<br />
Took away my dreams and wishes<br />
When he turned off the light<br />
i should have been a rockstar<br />
who would shine on every stage<br />
But I'm like a wounded tiger<br />
Who is locked inside a cage</p>

<p>They think I got it covered<br />
But inside I go insane<br />
Now my head became a prison<br />
And my best friend is a cane</p>

<p>Tell me why<br />
Why is this happening to me<br />
Why did my world disappear<br />
i can't let go<br />
No I can't let go<br />
but I must let go</p>

<p>I should have been your anchor<br />
But I'm lost and all alone<br />
But I hope youâ€™re having patience<br />
'Cause one day I'm coming home</p>

<p>Why, why is this happening to me<br />
Why did my world disappear<br />
I can't let go<br />
I can't let go<br />
No I can't let go<br />
But I must let go<br />
and embrace the unknown</p>
