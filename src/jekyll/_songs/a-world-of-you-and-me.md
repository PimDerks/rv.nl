<p>Waiting for a moment<br />
Waiting for a day<br />
Something in my mind won't let me say</p>

<p>The things I wish to tell you<br />
The words I meant to say<br />
And feelings that I have won't fade away</p>

<p>The more I'm trying<br />
And more I'm crying<br />
Sometimes I've been kissed not meant to be<br />
In a world. ooh. both you and me</p>

<p>I wonder how you're feeling<br />
I wonder where you are<br />
I'll never get the answers from the stars</p>

<p>I want so much to call you<br />
But I'm feeling to unsure<br />
I'm too afraid you're all I'm living for</p>

<p>The more I'm trying<br />
And more I'm crying<br />
Sometimes I've been kissed not meant to be<br />
In a world. ooh. both you and me</p>

<p>The more I'm crying<br />
The more I'm dying<br />
Sometimes I've been kissed not meant to be<br />
In the world. ooh. both you and me</p>
