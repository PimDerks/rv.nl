<p>My heart is like an island<br/>
Flooded by the sea<br/>
Darkness keeps growing in me<br/>
Hanging on a wire<br/>
Breathing through a straw<br/>
I just can't copy anymore</p>

<p>Where did my heart go<br/>
Faded by a mystery<br/>
Murdered by loneliness<br/>
Take me back, take me back<br/>
Where did my heart go<br/>
Somewhere in the ocean-sea<br/>
Died with my broken dream<br/>
I am still in love with you</p>

<p>Hear the sound of silence<br/>
The only place to be<br/>
It comforts and destroys me<br/>
On a desert island<br/>
Only you can find</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Solo</p>

<p>Chorus</p>
