composer: Robby Valentine
about: |
  This was the first song recorded for Bizarro World. It’s about all the trouble non-average people are going through. The black rain stands for all the bullying and name-calling, the teasing, the terror that us misfits have to go through. It’s about living in a world that’s not yours.
  
  There’s no solution or uplifting message lyrically, but the sound and vibe of the chorus does. It’s like it actually says, no matter what they say, no matter what they made us go through, we are misfits, and we are proud of it. The more haters and narrow minded people are trying to make us feel bad, the stronger we get, the better we feel about ourselves. If the mud-throwing is a consequence of being true to yourself, than we are proud, proud of walking in the black rain.

<p>I can't see through the darkness around me<br />
I can't breathe in the alternate world<br />
It's a death parade<br />
A leap of faith<br />
Colours to the blind<br />
Into the night<br />
Into the wild</p>

<p>I can't breath in the the hell that surrounds me<br />
I can't live in this substitute world<br />
It's a big mistake<br />
It's bend and break<br />
Turns you inside out<br />
Into the night<br />
Into the wild</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Black rain - black rain<br />
Black rain - is coming down<br />
Black rain - black rain<br />
Black rain - is falling down on me</p>

<p>It's too late for a new line of fashion<br />
Much too late for a new choice of fate<br />
Are you willing to die for a fatal conviction?<br />
Oooh the counterweight to the death parade<br />
Colours to the blind<br />
Into the night<br />
Into the wild</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus)</p>

<p class="em">(Solo)</p>

<p>I can't see through the darkness around me<br />
I can't breathe in the alternate world</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus x 2)</p>
