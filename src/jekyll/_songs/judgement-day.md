<p>Let's get it on tonight <br />
Eyes focused on the prize and bring it home <br />
Pumped up, adrenalized<br />
Maximum overdrive, we'll get it done</p>

<p>Here we are, face to face<br />
It's going down tonight <br />
No excuse, no delay<br />
The time is now!</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>This is war, it is Judgement Day<br />
Fighting the law, gotta make 'em pay<br />
Run away! Run away! To a new tomorrow<br />
Tearing down walls to a brand new day<br />
Fighting for truth, no we cannot fail<br />
Run away! Run away! To a new tomorrow<br />
Or tomorrow never comes</p>

<p>I gave it all my life <br />
Devotion and sacrife, a solemn vow<br />
Stand up for who we are<br /> 
We didn't get this far to screw up now</p>

<p>Here we are, face to face<br />
We're coming home tonight<br />
Go, make a change! The time is now!</p>

<p>This is war, it is Judgement Day<br />
Fighting the law, gotta make 'em pay<br />
Run away! Run away! To a new tomorrow<br />
Tearing down walls to a brand new day<br />
Fighting for truth, no we cannot fail<br />
Run away! Run away! To a new tomorrow<br />
Or tomorrow never comes</p>

<p class="em">Solo</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>Let's get it on tonight<br />
Or tomorrow never comes</p>

<p>Let's get it on tonight!</p>
