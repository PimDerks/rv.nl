<p>Club Bombastic<br />
Just when I was only seventeen<br />
I was a misfit on the scene<br />
Nowhere that I wanted to be<br />
When everyone else was having fun<br />
I was at home or on the run<br />
the emptiness would get into me<br />
I want to be where the smiles were for real<br />
And the crowd looked like in Purple Rain<br />
Oooh me and my furry friends</p>

<p>Now when I got older things have changed<br />
Not for the good to my dismay<br />
What did ever ruin it for me?<br />
See all of them fools in clubs and bars<br />
Doped by the drone of dorks, they're stars<br />
Far away from where I should be<br />
Everyone's clean, smoke- and alcohol-free<br />
Purple juice and strawberry shakes<br />
You and me and the perfect band</p>

<p>Wishing that it was for real the only place I wanna be</p>

<p>Take me to the Club Bombastic<br />
Place of grace - it's so fantastic<br />
A miracle-chant, that's the price you have to pay<br />
Take me to the Club Bombastic<br />
It's the place of sheer, pure magic<br />
All that I want, somewhere to belong</p>

<p>Now when I'm no longer seventeen<br />
I'm still a misfit on the scene<br />
No way I could ever be free<br />
Why there ain't a place where I could go<br />
It's probably there when I'm too old<br />
Murphy's always heading for me (but still I want to see)</p>

<p>Nothing to fear, all my friends are for real<br />
Music like in memory-lane<br />
Oooh my never-never-land</p>

<p>Wishing that it was for real the only place I wanna be</p>

<p>Take me to the Club Bombastic<br />
Place of grace - it's so fantastic<br />
A miracle-chant, that's the price you have to pay<br />
Take me to the Club Bombastic<br />
It's the place of sheer, pure magic<br />
All that I want, somewhere to belong</p>

<p>I wanna be where my friends are for real<br />
And the crowd looks like in Purple Rain<br />
Ooooh me and the perfect band</p>

<p>Wishing that it was for real the only place I wanna be</p>

<p>Take me to the Club Bombastic<br />
Place of grace - it's so fantastic<br />
A miracle-chant, that's the price you have to pay<br />
Take me to the Club Bombastic<br />
It's the place of sheer, pure magic<br />
All that I want, somewhere to belong</p>

<p>Take me to the Club Bombastic<br />
