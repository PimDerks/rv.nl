about: |
  I was messing around with a drum-loop, singing some lines over it that reminded me a bit of a Prince-sound. Maybe because of his song ‘Darling Nikki’ I began to sing ‘Mickey’. It made perfect sense because it was the nickname of my first teenage love. I concluded the song with a mid tempo-rock bridge and chorus. Though I must say to regret that. I Simply couldn’t come up with something good that would have fitted the idea and the feel the verse has. The live drums are again played by Noppy.
