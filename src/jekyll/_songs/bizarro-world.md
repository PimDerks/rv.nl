<p>I feel something viciously unkind here<br/>
All the wrong turned into right here<br/>
It seems like up is down<br/>
What's square is round</p>

<p>It's not real<br/>
How on earth did I end up here<br/>
Let me wake up from this bad dream<br/>
Backwards I walked the town and brought to the ground</p>

<p>Who can adjust himself to a world with opposite rules<br/>
Where injustice's fair and Superman's not there</p>

<p>God take me home<br/>
God can you right the wrong - I can't be...<br/>
Where the cure holds the disease, where the beauty is the beast</p>

<p>It's clear all that's beautiful must die here<br/>
It's a crime to make things right here<br/>
Where darkness shades the light and day is night</p>

<p>You don't know who you are here<br/>
Where you belong, why you're here<br/>
Why the planet's square and Superman's not there</p>

<p>God take me home<br/>
God can you right the wrong - I can't be...<br/>
Where the cure holds the disease, where the beauty is the beast<br/>
Welcome to Bizarro World</p>

<p>I can't adjust myself to a world with opposite rules<br/>
Where injustice's fair and Superman's not there</p>

<p>God can you right the wrong - I can't breathe<br/>
Where the cure holds the disease<br/>
where the beauty is the beast</p>

<p>God take me home (won't you take me home)<br/>
God can you right the wrong (tell me right from wrong) - I can't be...<br/>
Where the cure holds the disease, where the beauty is the beast<br/>
Welcome to Bizarro World</p>
