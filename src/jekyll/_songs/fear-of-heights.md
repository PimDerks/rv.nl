<p>I've seen the underworld alright<br />
I knew it would astound you<br />
Should overcome my fear of heights<br />
And live my life around you</p>

<p>If you want it you got it, they say<br />
Open your mind say you want to be saved<br />
But everytime I try I keep on losing sight</p>

<p>Can you see me now<br />
Can you see me now going down<br />
Just see me now, fighting fear of heights<br />
Tell me how can you teach me fly</p>

<p>Dreams of the afterworld collide<br />
With all my deep frustrations<br />
I feel the need to set things right<br />
And meet my expectations</p>

<p>If you want it you got it, they say<br />
Just set your mind and you'll accomplish one day<br />
But everytime I tried I failed to do it right</p>

<p>Can you see me now<br />
Can you see me now going down<br />
Just see me now, fighting fear of heights<br />
Tell me how can you teach me fly</p>

<p>I live in a world of solitude<br />
I blame it on my perfecty youth<br />
I know I'll never feel the same</p>

<p>Can you see me now<br />
Can you see me now going down<br />
Just see me now, fighting fear of heights<br />
Tell me how can you teach me fly</p>
