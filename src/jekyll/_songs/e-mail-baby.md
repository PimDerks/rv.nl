<p>I got an e-mail from Miss<br />
must be the cutest girl that I've never seen</p>

<p>"A black lace teddy, longest hair, highest heels"<br />
Well no big deal, I've got to see this for real</p>

<p>E-mail baby, can't you see<br />
E-mail love between you & me<br />
E-mail baby can't you see</p>

<p>Agreed to meet in Paris, I booked a flight<br />
and on the Eiffel-tower someone said "Hi!"<br />
The woman's clothing, guess that wasn't a lie<br />
the rest of her turned out to be a guy</p>

<p>E-mail baby, can't you see<br />
E-mail love between you & me<br />
E-mail baby can't you see</p>

<p>E-mail baby, can't you see<br />
E-mail love between you & me<br />
E-mail baby can't you see</p>
