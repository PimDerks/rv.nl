  Three little pieces put together. The end part is an attempt of a mid 70’s Brian May type of solo on vaudeville music that I had in my head for 10 years. As a huge fan I even played it on a copy of his guitar, though not through a Vox AC 30, but a Fender combo. With very tastefully played drums by Juan.

  The middle part’s a happy 60’s sounding thing, about a trip to England. And the first part a ballad about childhood memories. How my parents supported me, the music I grew up with, that became like a bible. Queen’s ‘A Night At The Opera’ was the first album I got. A present for my 7th birthday from my grand mother. And I mention ‘Every time I think of You ‘ from the Babys, my first introduction to the beautiful voice of John Waite, since then I’m a huge fan . ‘Mr. Blue Sky’, My favourite ELO song. Those were the 3 most important bands for me when I grew up: Queen, ELO , The Babys.
