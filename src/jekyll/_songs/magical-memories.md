about: |
  Three little pieces put together. The end part is an attempt of a mid 70’s Brian May type of solo on vaudeville music that I had in my head for 10 years. As a huge fan I even played it on a copy of his guitar, though not through a Vox AC 30, but a Fender combo. With very tastefully played drums by Juan.

  The middle part’s a happy 60’s sounding thing, about a trip to England. And the first part a ballad about childhood memories. How my parents supported me, the music I grew up with, that became like a bible. Queen’s ‘A Night At The Opera’ was the first album I got. A present for my 7th birthday from my grand mother. And I mention ‘Every time I think of You ‘ from the Babys, my first introduction to the beautiful voice of John Waite, since then I’m a huge fan . ‘Mr. Blue Sky’, My favourite ELO song. Those were the 3 most important bands for me when I grew up: Queen, ELO , The Babys.

<p>I grew up with "A Night At The Opera"<br />
My mum and dad, they were the best<br />
"Mr. Blue Sky" and "Everytime I Think Of You"<br />
Those were the hits, my youth was blessed<br />
It was the key to a dream<br />
To show a world no one's ever seens<br />
The wonder years, if only they could last</p>

<p>1 o'clock I gotta go<br />
I gotta get down to the station<br />
Gonna see my babe this afternoon<br />
Cheerio, we gotta go to the great circus-show<br />
With Billy Blue and the tumbler too<br />
Fooling around</p>

<p>You and me - honeybee - on a trip over the ocean<br />
Went to see my dear old friend called Rupert<br />
Those were the days, we were ace<br />
But love wouldn't stay<br />
But no one takes these memories away</p>
