<p>Deadbeat boy, did you buy a new toy<br />
    No way you're replacing me<br />
    Ain't gonna give it up, ain't gonna giddy up and go go, no no<br />
    Don't get coy, I will suck all the joy<br />
    Out of all of your crazy dreams<br />
    Dare me to shiver 'em, better be quivering<br />
    Back down, back down</p>

<p>I want your body and soul, I got you under control<br />
    No way you're escaping from me</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Lay it down, you're gonna get pushed around<br />
    And I'll show you how revenge can feel<br />
    Take me down and I'll bury you into the ground<br />
    Na na know there's no way out of here<br />
    You better back down</p>

<p>Deadbeat boy, gonna kill and destroy<br />
    Can't keep avoiding me<br />
    Ain't ever give it up, don't think I'll ever let go go, no no<br />
    Deadbeat boy, did you get a new toy<br />
    Nobody's gonna take you from me<br />
    Cry me a river, just stand and deliver<br />
    You go down, go down</p>

<p>I want your body and soul, I got you under control<br />
    No way you will get out of here</p>
