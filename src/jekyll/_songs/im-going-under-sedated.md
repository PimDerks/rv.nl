about: |
  My anti Anti-Depression medicine song. Beyond a ‘Most Beautiful Pain’ feeling, I couldn’t hardly make it through the day because of heavy depressions. This song is literally.

  A constant fight against taking anti–depression medicine. But sometimes it feels like the only way. Got the medicine, but the fear it would numb me and take away the spare moments of creativity fortunately kept me from taking it.

<p>Help me doctor - give me something<br />
I'm going under - I'm going under<br />
It's my baby - since she left me<br />
I'm going under - I'm going under</p>

<p>All the disillusions<br />
All deceptions couldn't break me down (Couldn't break me down)<br />
But now I'm licking windows, pull my hair out<br />
I need something now<br />
Think I gotta be - gotta be - gotta be</p>

<p>Sedated - sedated - sedated - I gotta be...<br />
Sedated - sedated - sedated - sedate me now</p>

<p>Please dear doctor - can you help me<br />
I'm going under - I'm going under<br />
Give me something to forget her<br />
She is my wonder - my holy wonder</p>

<p>All the disappointments<br />
All the drama's couldn't break me down (Couldn't break me down)<br />
But since she's gone away I'm losing faith<br />
I can't breath no more<br />
Think I gotta be - gotta be - gotta be</p>

<p>Sedated - sedated - sedated - I gotta be...<br />
Sedated - sedated - sedated - sedate me now</p>

<p>No matter how I try to fool myself, try to cool myself, I gotta prove myself<br />
Ain't no freakin' medicine screwing up my mind</p>

<p>Sedated - sedated - sedated - don't wanna be...<br />
Sedated - sedated - sedated - don't wanna be...<br />
Sedated (I hate it) - sedated (I hate it) - sedated - don't wanna be<br />
Sedated (I hate it) - sedated (I hate it) - sedated<br />
Sedate me now</p>

<p>I'm going under</p>
