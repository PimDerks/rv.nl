  My anti Anti-Depression medicine song. Beyond a ‘Most Beautiful Pain’ feeling, I couldn’t hardly make it through the day because of heavy depressions. This song is literally.

  A constant fight against taking anti–depression medicine. But sometimes it feels like the only way. Got the medicine, but the fear it would numb me and take away the spare moments of creativity fortunately kept me from taking it.
