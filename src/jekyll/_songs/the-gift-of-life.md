<p>Take no failure - live no life in dreams<br />
Always waiting for a change<br />
Still you're longing for a world<br />
That's not so cruel<br />
Life on earth feels so insane</p>

<p>You can't stand you're always on your own<br />
(You're hanging on a wire)<br />
Why you never had no friends<br />
Feel so sad<br />
But you've got enough of all those tears<br />
'Cause they're coming back each day<br />
They're coming back till</p>

<p>You know - life is a gift<br />
Don't go - try to believe<br />
Trying - I wanna make you understand<br />
You know - life is to live<br />
Don't go - try to receive<br />
Crying - still comes back till<br />
You know - the gift of life</p>

<p>You're a winner in your fantasies<br />
But in real life you're lost<br />
You never try to fight<br />
Depression rules your mind<br />
No it never fades away<br />
It never fades till</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>I know it's hard when you're on your own<br />
I know it's cruel living all alone<br />
Just reach out for a hand<br />
There's always someone who understands<br />
It's not as hard as it seems</p>

<p>Just try to receive<br />
This is the game you must not leave<br />
You only win if you want<br />
(If you want)<br />
I can see you're out of strength<br />
You're incomplete<br />
You must fight<br />
Then you won't be your own defeat</p>

<p>Just try to hold on<br />
Never give up<br />
You'll find your way out<br />
Right back to love</p>

<p>Give your life - existence<br />
Give this fight - resistance<br />
Live your life - subsistence<br />
Leave this fight - out distance</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
