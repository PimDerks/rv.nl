<p>There's a little star so bright
Comes into the heart of each child
And shows the one truth ever tells
The one clue in this carousel
Failed by the storm outside
Grew up in a world full of strict religious laws
To fight for the land
Their one truth leads to the very end</p>

<p>We share the same sun
Where did we go wrong
Please sing us a song
You know the words we sing along
Time will carry on</p>

<p>We stared at the sun
See what we have done
There once was love but now our future's gone
Heading for Avalon</p>

<p>Faded by a blinding light
Blew away the world
No one did survive that world war
As smart as we seem
We can't stop
In the prophet's dream</p>

<p>Find a little love inside
Try to reconcile with your soul
Like there's just one day left in this life
Just one chance for we will face that light</p>

<p>We share the same sun
Where did we go wrong
Please sing us a song
You know the words we sing along
Time will carry on</p>

<p>We stared at the sun
See what we have done
There once was love but now our future's gone
Heading for Avalon</p>

<p>Silence is faithless beware for the storm
There's a new world ahead here we can't carry on</p>

<p>For the love<br/>
For the life<br/>
For the truth<br/>
Darling, came into the silence, came into my life and...</p>

<p>For the love<br/>
For the life<br/>
For the truth<br/>
Darling, came into the silence, but it's really much too late</p>

<p>We share the same sun<br/>
Where did we go wrong<br/>
Please sing us a song<br/>
You know the words we sing along<br/>
Time will carry on</p>

<p>We stared at the sun<br/>
See what we have done<br/>
There once was love but now our future's gone<br/>
Heading for Avalon</p>

<p>There once was love but now our future's gone<br/>
Heading for Avalon<br/>
We once were lost but found a place where we belong<br/>
Heading for Avalon<br/>
Heading for Avalon</p>
