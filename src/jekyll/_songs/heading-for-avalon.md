<p>There's a little star so bright<br />
Comes into the heart of each child<br />
And shows the one truth ever tells<br />
The one clue in this carousel<br />
Failed by the storm outside<br />
Grew up in a world full of strict religious laws<br />
To fight for the land<br />
Their one truth leads to the very end</p>

<p>We share the same sun<br />
Where did we go wrong<br />
Please sing us a song<br />
You know the words we sing along<br />
Time will carry on</p>

<p>We stared at the sun<br />
See what we have done<br />
There once was love but now our future's gone<br />
Heading for Avalon</p>

<p>Faded by a blinding light<br />
Blew away the world<br />
No one did survive that world war<br />
As smart as we seem<br />
We can't stop<br />
In the prophet's dream</p>

<p>Find a little love inside<br />
Try to reconcile with your soul<br />
Like there's just one day left in this life<br />
Just one chance for we will face that light</p>

<p>We share the same sun<br />
Where did we go wrong<br />
Please sing us a song<br />
You know the words we sing along<br />
Time will carry on</p>

<p>We stared at the sun<br />
See what we have done<br />
There once was love but now our future's gone<br />
Heading for Avalon</p>

<p>Silence is faithless beware for the storm<br />
There's a new world ahead here we can't carry on</p>

<p>For the love<br/>
For the life<br/>
For the truth<br/>
Darling, came into the silence, came into my life and...</p>

<p>For the love<br/>
For the life<br/>
For the truth<br/>
Darling, came into the silence, but it's really much too late</p>

<p>We share the same sun<br/>
Where did we go wrong<br/>
Please sing us a song<br/>
You know the words we sing along<br/>
Time will carry on</p>

<p>We stared at the sun<br/>
See what we have done<br/>
There once was love but now our future's gone<br/>
Heading for Avalon</p>

<p>There once was love but now our future's gone<br/>
Heading for Avalon<br/>
We once were lost but found a place where we belong<br/>
Heading for Avalon<br/>
Heading for Avalon</p>
