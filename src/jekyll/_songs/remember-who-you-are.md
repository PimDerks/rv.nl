<p>What can I do, little me<br />
Cuff my hands and chain my feet</p>

<p>You can stop your kids going off to war<br />
Question all the things that you've learned before<br />
Open up your eyes, wake up from the lies<br />
Spread your wings and fly</p>

<p>Just be yourself - Don't play someone else<br />
Don't waste another day - Let love lead the way<br />
Just be yourself and nobody else<br />
Don't turn into another tied up fool<br />
Don't let anybody kill the one you are<br />
You're a guiding star</p>

<p>Always wanna quit your stupid job<br />
But you never did<br />
One day you would give it all up<br />
But you never did</p>

<p>Now you're stuck inside a puppet-show<br />
A mortgage slave without a little hope<br />
But you can change your destiny<br />
The truth will always set you free</p>

<p>Just be yourself - Don't blame no one else<br />
Don't look the other way <br />
It's your choice to make<br />
Just be yourself - Don't play someone else<br />
And don't comply to someone else's lie<br />
Don't let anybody change the way you are<br />
You're a shining star</p>

<p class="em">Solo</p>

<p>Just be yourself - Don't play someone else<br />
Don't waste another day - Let love lead the way<br />
Just be yourself and nobody else<br />
Don't turn into another stupid fool<br />
Don't let anyone destroy the one you are<br />
You're a guiding star</p>

<p>Remember who you are - Remember who you are<br />
Remember who you are - Now the world's on fire<br />
Remember who you are - Remember who you are<br />
Remember who you are - Now the world's on fire<br />
Remember who you are - Remember who you are<br />
Remember who you are</p>

<p>And the world's on fire now</p>
