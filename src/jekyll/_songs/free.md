<p>Once I thought I got it all for free (I believed!)<br />
but I had to find<br />
...this ain't Heaven (This sure ain't Heaven for me!)</p>

<p>Yes, the road was long<br />
& hostile mystery (talk about, talk about it)<br />
but I know, right now<br />
that the price won't come easy to me</p>

<p>My persistent attitude<br />
get me close to the truth</p>

<p>Come make me change you<br />
You make me change</p>

<p>Once I thought (Once I thought that I got it all for... All for free!)<br />
I got it all for free<br />
but I know the price right now<br />
that the price won't come easy to me</p>

<p>Guess I just was right about<br />
who would ever let me down<br />
(Again and again and again and you take me away)<br />
But it's dogged as does it yes, I'm here to stay<br />
Got to hold on, got to hold on anyway<br />
(Yeah, yeah, yeah!)</p>

<p>Once I thought<br />
I got it all for free<br />
but I know right NOW<br />
that the price won't come easy to me</p>

<p>Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm</p>

<p>Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm</p>

<p>Gonna be free - I'm
Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm<br />
Gonna be free - I'm</p>

<p>Free<br />
I'm free<br />
I'm free... yeah!</p>

<p>My persistent attitude<br />
get me close to the truth</p>

<p>Come make me change you<br />
You make me change</p>

<p>Once I thought<br />
I got it all for free (but then again nothing's for free...)<br />
but I know right now<br />
that the price won't come easy to me</p>

<p>I am free...</p>
