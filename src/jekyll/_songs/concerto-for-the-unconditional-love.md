<p>Hear my plea, I beg you Father<br />
Will you please let this sacred love succeed<br />
Without it I can't live or breathe<br />
And I will lose my goal<br />
Please protect our souls</p>

<p>Hear my plea, I ask you on my hands and knees<br />
Give me all the strength I need<br />
My human heart is much too weak<br />
To face it on my own<br />
Will you please protect our souls</p>

<p>'Cause no one understands<br />
The way that I am, the way how I feel<br />
The reason I live, I breath, I give<br />
I bleed, I laugh, I cry, I scream<br />
Please let me live this dream</p>

<p>As I walked down the river<br />
With a gun in my hand<br />
And send my tortured soul<br />
To the promised land<br />
(Nothing changes, no one really cares)</p>

<p>But it feels like I'm drowning<br />
In the sea of grief<br />
I try to get above but I'm in too deep<br />
(I'm asking, begging for your helping hand)</p>

<p>I have repentance, I was stupid<br />
For my soul was blind</p>

<p>Why did I leave you, why did I dare<br />
Why did I deceive you, why do you care<br />
You are still there,<br />
You're taking me up in the air</p>

<p>I will come through, I will come through<br />
Out of the darkness<br />
I will come through, I will come through<br />
Out of the darkness, darkness<br />
We shall overcome</p>

<p>Stop, deary people in the name of love<br />
Sacrifice your souls to the one above<br />
(Everybody needs the upperhand)<br />
I was a searcher how I went astray<br />
Sold my soul to the demon<br />
Went the devil's way<br />
(But God almighty took me back again)</p>

<p>I showed regret<br />
And raised my hands up to the skies above<br />
And felt his unconditional love</p>

<p>I will come through, I will come through<br />
Out of the darkness<br />
I will come through, I will come through<br />
Out of the darkness, darkness<br />
We shall overcome</p>

<p>I will come through, I will come through<br />
Out of the darkness<br />
I will come through, I will come through<br />
Out of the darkness, darkness<br />
I know I will survive, I'm alive<br />
We shall overcome</p>

<p>I will come through, I will come through<br />
Out of the darkness with you</p>
