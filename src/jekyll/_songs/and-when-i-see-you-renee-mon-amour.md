<p>I wouldn't say that she is something new<br />
Look down from her hips up to her head</p>

<p>I used to say I was a non-believer<br />
but I must admit that God was in my head</p>

<p>And when I see you<br />
Just want to feel you<br />
And when I see you I feel fine</p>

<p>Everytime I see you<br />
Just want to be with you<br />
And when I touch you I feel fine</p>

<p>I wouldn't say that she was something new<br />
taking all her clothes off in my head</p>

<p>...just walk away Renee<br />
I could not believe her<br />
She said: "I am in love with someone else"</p>

<p>And when I see you<br />
Just want to feel you<br />
And when I see you I feel fine</p>

<p>Everytime I see you<br />
Just want to be with you<br />
And when I touch you I feel fine</p>
