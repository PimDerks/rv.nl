<p>Times have changed<br />
But I just need<br />
Some time to rearrange<br />
To guide me back again<br />
Love has flown<br />
But I can't take<br />
This pressure on my own<br />
I walk on sinking sand</p>

<p>Time to realise<br />
Life is much too short<br />
Time to wonder why<br />
What I'm living for<br />
Without your love</p>

<p>I need you love<br />
I need it now<br />
I need to be with you tonight<br />
I need your touch<br />
I need your faith<br />
I need to feel you deep inside<br />
Hold me one more time</p>

<p>It's so hard<br />
'Cause I will always wonder<br />
Who you are<br />
Even when you're gone<br />
Now all I do<br />
Is cherish all my memories of you<br />
By knowing it's so wrong</p>

<p>I must clear my eyes<br />
And stop this endless war<br />
I must lose those lies<br />
It ain't worth living for<br />
Without your love</p>

<p>I need you love<br />
I need it now<br />
I need to be with you tonight<br />
I need your touch<br />
I need your faith<br />
I need to feel you deep inside<br />
I was wrong to think<br />
That I was meant for you<br />
Now I just can't face the truth</p>

<p>Time will tell<br />
It will heal the wound inside<br />
But this pain<br />
Is still so difficult to hide<br />
Without your love</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>I need your love - can't get enough<br />
I need your love<br />
I need your love<br />
I need your love - can't get enough<br />
I need your love<br />
I need your love</p>
