<p>Tell me what I gotta do<br />
Tell me how to get through the night<br />
Give me just a little clue<br />
‘cause I’m really messed up this time</p>

<p>Anybody see me?<br />
Can anybody feel me?<br />
But I scare them all way</p>

<p>Tell me what I have to do<br />
To get out of here alive<br />
I don’t think that I can make it through<br />
But I really don’t want to die</p>

<p>Anybody see me?<br />
Can anybody free me?<br />
From the darkness that surrounds me all my life</p>

<p>Without a word to say<br />
I push my love away<br />
Just when I need her the most</p>

<p>(make me) Sing---<br />
Open the door just let me in<br />
Into a brighter world<br />
Find back what I’ve lost<br />
No matter the cost<br />
‘Cause I really can’t go on another day</p>

<p>Oh I’m getting so fed up <br />
With this fog inside my head<br />
Even in the glory-days<br />
No I wasn’t really there</p>

<p>Anybody see me?<br />
Can anybody feel me?<br />
But I push them all aside</p>

<p>Outside the sun is shining bright<br />
There’s nothing but blue skies<br />
While inside all hell breaks loose<br />
Rain and thunder rule my mind</p>

<p>Honey can you see me<br />
Honey can you free me<br />
Without a word to say<br />
I chase them all away <br />
Now that I need them the most</p>

<p>(please make me) Sing---<br />
Open the door just let me in<br />
Into a brighter world<br />
Find back what I’ve lost<br />
No matter the cost<br />
‘Cause I really can’t go on another day</p>

<p>Stop the rain…</p>

<p>As the years go by<br />
And the tears run dry<br />
And the numbness takes control</p>

<p>Open the door just let me in<br />
Into a brighter world<br />
Find back what I’ve lost<br />
No matter the cost<br />
‘Cause I really can’t go on another day</p>

<p>Make me sing ---<br />
Oh God the walls are closing in<br />
Don’t let me drown tonight<br />
I’ll carry the loss<br />
But give me some trust<br />
That in the end it all won’t be in vain</p>

<p>Stop the rain…<br />
Stop the rain…<br />
Stop the rain…</p>
