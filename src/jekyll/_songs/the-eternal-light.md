<p>Somehow, somewhere - we'll meet again<br />
I know you're there - waiting for the time<br />
When we all unite<br />
In the everlasting light</p>

<p>I know you pray, I'd do it right<br />
Each lonely day - through the darkest night<br />
When I can't take no more<br />
Close my eyes and find</p>

<p>Oceans so deep and mountains so high<br />
I promise to swear, I swear I would climb<br />
Father in heaven, don't leave me behind<br />
In the end I live to see the eternal light</p>

<p>Outside it's cold, anger and hate<br />
When dreams've been sold<br />
Endlessly I waited for the change of time<br />
But purity is far behind</p>

<p>I know it's true I opened my eyes<br />
This place is cursed<br />
Drifted off from faith and all it's harmony<br />
But there's more the eye can see</p>

<p>Oceans so deep and mountains so high<br />
I promise to swear, I swear I would climb<br />
Father in heaven, don't leave me behind<br />
In the end I live to see the eternal light</p>
