<p>Soon we'll be gone and up to heaven - our dreams will fly<br />
They will not die - Lost, they'll be haunting us forever<br />
We did not try hard enough in life</p>

<p>Soon or late your conscience always finds you<br />
Deep down inside the guilt is always there<br />
There's another way to try<br />
Don't give up without a fight - It's there, Anywhere</p>

<p>How could I touch the sky - or hold my head up high
This world of tainted lies - I wish it all away<br />
How could I turn the tide without some guiding light<br />
Could I put up a fight and wash the tears away<br />
How could I aim so high</p>

<p>I thought I was better off without them<br />
I buried them all inside my soul<br />
Instead I must face this deadly silence<br />
And lose control of life without a goal</p>

<p>Don't give up the reason for surving<br />
The journey's sometimes better than the glare<br />
There's another way to try, don't give up without a fight<br />
It's there, Anywhere</p>

<p>How could I touch the sky - or hold my head up high<br />
This world of tainted lies - I wish it all away<br />
How could I turn the tide without some guiding light<br />
Could I put up a fight and wash the tears away<br />
How could I aim so high</p>
