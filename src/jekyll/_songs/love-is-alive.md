<p>I know what it is<br />
Feeling lonely and lost in yourself<br />
I know how it feels<br />
When you can't find the cure on a shelf<br />
Will you always be sad<br />
For the rest of your life<br />
Never forget that it cuts like a knife<br />
Colours your world like a painting<br />
In all kinds of blue</p>

<p>Ain't no lie - no one can show you the way<br />
Tell me why - nothing will light up your day</p>

<p>With a heart full of soul<br />
But still out of control<br />
You'll never make it to the borderline<br />
If you don't change the road to your heart</p>

<p>Love is alive - don't you know why<br />
Cuts like a knife in your soul<br />
Love is alive - waiting to answer your call<br />
Standing with your back to the wall</p>

<p>You're running away from the problems<br />
That worry your mind<br />
You're searching all day<br />
But tears you have cried made you blind<br />
Won't you ever forget that ties always bind<br />
Will you get by - 'cause love ain't so kind<br />
Only a dream and it seems<br />
It will never come true</p>

<p>Ain't no lie - someone can show you the way<br />
Tell me why - something will light up your day</p>
