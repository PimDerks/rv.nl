<p>Do you ever close your eyes and then...<br />
Think about the times when we were friends<br />
Do you ever miss your bro?<br />
Blaming me for fame that passed us by<br />
Wanted me to change and live a lie<br />
Tell me was it all for show?</p>

<p>In the darkness<br />
Haunted by the shadows<br />
Aching for your friendship<br />
Searching for some light<br />
Held my torch up<br />
Through insanely rough roads<br />
All these times that I thought<br />
you were on my side</p>

<p>I never understood what I'd done wrong<br />
When suddenly your faith in me was gone<br />
Left me standing on my own<br />
You knew I couldn't change<br />
I had no choice<br />
But to listen to my heart<br />
the inner voice<br />
I can never let it turn to stone</p>

<p>In the spotlights<br />
Hiding for the dark nights<br />
On our quest for stardom<br />
We were shining bright<br />
But when minds turned narrow<br />
Shot their poisoned arrows<br />
They could never touch me<br />
But hit you in the eye</p>

<p>In the end, in the end<br />
You'll always be my friend<br />
In the end, in the end<br />
You'll always be my friend<br />
But you didn't give a damn</p>

<p>Remember when you tore me all apart<br />
Sided with the rest to crush my heart<br />
I never felt so betrayed<br />
Stabbed me in the back with burning knives<br />
You couldn't even look me in the eyes<br />
Left me standing in the rain</p>

<p>Through the dark nights<br />
Searching for some answers<br />
Always would deny them<br />
Why you left my side<br />
Infected by the virus<br />
That's called fame and fortune<br />
That's what did divide us<br />
Took away your light</p>

<p>In the end , in the end<br />
In the end<br />
You'll always be my friend<br />
In the end, in the end<br />
In the end, in the end<br />
You'll always be my friend<br />
In the end, in the end<br />
In the end aaaah<br />
I thought you were my friend<br />
But you didn't give a damn</p>
