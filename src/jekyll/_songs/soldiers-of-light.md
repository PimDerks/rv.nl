<p>Pretty little girl, wanna be a star?<br />
Then you gotta change everything you are<br />
We can make your wishes come true<br />
Screw your inner god, here you gotta sign<br />
With a little blood on the dotted line<br />
Wile away your heart , wile away your heart</p>

<p>NOTHING NEVER EVER COMES FOR FREE<br />
RUN AWAY WHILE YOU CAN ...and say!</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Fuck you fame, I'm not in on this game<br />
I will show you how we will do things now<br />
WE ARE THE SOLDIERS OF LIGHT<br />
Fuck you fame, I am sick of this game<br />
Of corrupting brains for the Archon reign<br />
WE HAVE THE TRUTH ON OUR SIDE<br />
And kill with a blinding light</p>

<p>Blind ambitioned boy plays a mean guitar<br />
Wants the latest toys and eleven cars<br />
And packed arenas shouting his name<br />
Doing everything, whatever it takes<br />
Jumping for the bling in the pit of snakes<br />
See the stupid fool now becomes a tool</p>

<p>THEY WILL WASH AWAY THE ONE YOU ARE<br />
RUN BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE ...and say</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>Every man has darkness and God-power in his heart<br />
Careful now which road you follow<br />
Right or wrong, weak or strong</p>

<p class="em">Solo</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>
