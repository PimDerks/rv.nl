<p>Please don't forget me - baby - baby<br />
Just feel what I feel - baby - maybe<br />
There's still a chance for us<br />
Still I would live and die for you</p>

<p>You can't deny it - allright - allright<br />
We both know my key fits - all night - allright<br />
In my dreams I'm always making love to you<br />
Right now it's just the only thing I wanna do</p>

<p>Woohoo - love takes me higher<br />
Woohoo - sets me on fire<br />
I can give you all that love can buy<br />
So take me home tonight</p>

<p>I still remember - lovin' - kissin'<br />
Girl you're the answer to all I'm missin'<br />
I just can't find my way<br />
It's all so senseless without you</p>

<p>I can't stand we're separate - baby - baby<br />
Makes me so desperate - baby just take me<br />
Ooh 'cause I'm still singing all my songs for you<br />
Right now it's just the only thing I can do</p>

<p>Woohoo - love takes me higher<br />
Woohoo - sets me on fire<br />
I can give you all that love can buy<br />
So lose the other guy</p>

<p>Woohoo - love takes me higher<br />
Woohoo - sets me on fire<br />
I can give you all that love can buy<br />
So lose the other guy<br />
Who's the other guy</p>

<p>Woohoo - love takes me higher<br />
Woohoo - sets me on fire<br />
I can give you all that love can buy<br />
So take me home tonight<br />
Tonight - tonight - tonight - tonight</p>
