Dear dad<br />
I know I've disappointed you so bad, dear dad,<br />
all I do is feeling sorry for myself.<br />
Dear dad, it feels like all the good is in the past,<br />
dear dad, it looks like only sorrow's up ahead<br />
Dear dad, I just want to be with you, in another world.</p>

<p>Heal me, Father, heal my soul,<br />
heal my heart, I can't take no more.<br />
I don't believe it, you're not gone<br />
I still wait when you're coming home,<br />
my dad, my best friend.</p>

<p>Dear dad, I realise my life is not so bad, but dad,<br />
I miss the dedication I once had. <br />
Dear dad, sometimes I feel so down,<br />
I don't know how to cure.</p>

<p>Dear dad, remember all the great times that we shared.<br />
Dear dad, I hate to know they're buried in the past.<br />
Dear dad, I can't wait to be with you...<br />
In the better world...</p>

<p>Heal me, Father, heal my soul,<br />
heal my heart, I can't take no more.<br />
I don't believe it, you're not gone.<br />
I still wait for you to come home.<br />
My dad... my best friend.</p>

<p>Heal me, Father, heal my soul,<br />
heal my heart, I can't take no more.<br />
I don't believe it, you're not gone.<br />
I still wait for you to come home.<br />
My dad, my dad, my best friend.</p>
