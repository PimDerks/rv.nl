<p>Just a friend - It ain't easy to pretend
Just a girl who crossed my path and changed my world
Just a dream came into my life  
I couldn't close my eyes - God knows I tried</p>

<p>It was way too strong - I'm only human after all
I had no choice 
No resistance to the voice that's telling me  you were sent to me
It is destiny - But it cannot be</p>

<p>I cannot tell it to the world 
You don't know half how much it hurts
But there's no choice to keep it to myself
How could we stay in separate worlds when you're my angel send to earth
It's killing me to keep it to myself
But time will tell - Time will tell</p>

<p>Time stood still - We had no choice  we had no will
The first embrace - The first time I touched your face
I can't believe that we fit so well   
But it such a shame that we cannot tell
Just a friend - It ain't easy to pretend  
Just a girl who crossed my path and changed my world
You're a dream came into my life
I could not deny - God knows I tried</p>

<p>I cannot tell it to the world
You don't know half how much it hurts
But there's no choice to keep it to myself
When you're with me it feels so right
It's such a shame we have to hide
But then  you go and leave me in the night</p>

<p>How could we stay in separate worlds when you're my angel send to earth
It's killing me to keep it to myself
But time will tell - Time will tell
You know it hurts torn apart in separate worlds</p>
