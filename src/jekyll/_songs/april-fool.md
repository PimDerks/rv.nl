title: April Fool
year: 2006
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: |
  Industrial and melodic with some characteristic ‘Valentine ’vocal - harmonies, makes it a unique track altogether. Built upon a sample-loop this is unlike the way RV usually gets to work. Therefore the quickest Valentine song ever written and recorded.

<p>So I finally came clean to your wishes<br />
Forever yours, and what did I get?<br />
For months and months away from eachother<br />
I spared my soul you failed me instead</p>

<p>I put my new shoes on it wasn't right or wrong<br />
I'd wait and wonder, I dialed your number<br />
To soothe my troubled mind</p>

<p>Straight through my heart, you shot me down again<br />
Straight through my heart, you gave me hope again<br />
I can't breathe - I am just too blind to see<br />
I've been so uncool, I'm the April fool</p>

<p>Waited so long, made a decision<br />
Despite your will I'd surprise you instead<br />
I bought a ring, a man on a mission<br />
Went for your hand, but what did I get?</p>

<p>The memory lingers on<br />
The pain from what you've done<br />
You wouldn't see me - I couldn't touch you<br />
I was killed that night</p>

<p>Straight through my heart, you shot me down again<br />
Straight through my heart, you gave me hope again<br />
I can't breathe - I am just too blind to see<br />
I've been so uncool, I'm the April fool</p>

<p>I just can't live with this open end<br />
You were my lover, my dream, my friend<br />
It isn't over until it's over<br />
My life is in your hands</p>
