<p>Rain keeps falling down on me<br />
Ever since that day you just went away<br />
How our lives turned upside down<br />
And no one told us why we couldn't say goodbye<br />
But it's all for a reason<br />
All for a much greater cause<br />
Just as always, just as always</p>

<p>If I could turn back time I would<br />
That Sunday - as if nothing really happened<br />
If I could turn back time I would<br />
That one day - as if nothing really happened<br />
Now that nothing really matters at all</p>

<p>Love was finally in my life<br />
After all those times<br />
that my mind went astray<br />
Lost and nowhere to be found<br />
The joy to make a day<br />
with you it went away<br />
Is it all for a reason?<br />
Love's gone - how can I be strong<br />
Just as always, just as always</p>

<p>Chorus

<p>Tossing and turning my mind spins around<br />
The darkness is deafening just without a sound<br />
What does it take to be true, to get over you</p>
