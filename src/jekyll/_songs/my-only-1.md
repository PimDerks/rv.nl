<p>I just don't know how I got through<br />
This lonely life without you<br />
This big deception, the disaffection<br />
Darkened my mind, how it colored me blue</p>

<p>What did I know, how could I see<br />
The fading trust infected me<br />
But since I saw you my wish did come true<br />
I stay by your side come what may - anyway</p>

<p>When I live - when I die<br />
All I have - I give to you<br />
When I wish - when I cry<br />
When I fight - I do it for you<br />
Together we're strong<br />
Baby you're my only one</p>

<p>It's like a dream I stepped into<br />
A story from a fairytale book<br />
You're my perfection<br />
Gave me direction<br />
All my life I've been searching for you</p>

<p>Can't think of my life without you<br />
Your love would always guide me through<br />
My love's forever<br />
It's now or never<br />
I stay by your side come what may - anyway</p>
