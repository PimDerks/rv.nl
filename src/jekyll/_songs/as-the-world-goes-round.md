<p>Dreams of Eden in your mind<br />
As my love for you will find<br />
As the world goes 'round</p>

<p>Through our sacreligious lives<br />
Destined love of ours will rise<br />
As the world goes 'round</p>

<p>I feel</p>

<p>Now I am in love<br />
I am in love<br />
I'm in love now...<br />
I'm in love now...</p>

<p>Dreams of Eden in your mind<br />

As the world goes 'round</p>

<p>Now I am in love<br />
I am in love<br />
I'm in love now...<br />
I'm in love now...</p>

<p>Oh, I am in love<br />
I am in love<br />
I'm in love now...<br />
I'm in love now...</p>
