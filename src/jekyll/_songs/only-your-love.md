<p>I'm lost in a senseless fight<br />
Searching for the truth in my life<br />
I feel it's an endless lie<br />
Only with you I survive</p>

<p>I thought our last goodbye<br />
Would help me find my way<br />
(To find my way)<br />
But no matter how hard I try<br />
Only you can make me say</p>

<p>Only you love - only your love<br />
Can put me back together<br />
Only you love - only your love<br />
Can send my mind up to heaven<br />
Nothing can reach me enough<br />
Only your love</p>

<p>My life is a restless night<br />
Always it's you on my mind<br />
It's so hard<br />
'Cause it feels so right<br />
Angel my love never dies</p>

<p>If feels like I've lost my home<br />
I'll never find my way<br />
(It won't succeed)<br />
Can't you see that I'm so alone<br />
You're the only one that I need</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>How could this dream survive<br />
After all that I've been through<br />
(All that I've been through)<br />
How come my love don't die<br />
Can't you see it's true<br />
(My love for you)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
