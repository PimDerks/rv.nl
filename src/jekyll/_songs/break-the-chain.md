<p>Break the chain,<br />
stand up and fight!</p>

<p>We're stars<br />
Born to shine<br />
But the government is 
  keeping us in line<br />
We're trapped<br />
Hypnotized<br />
While the media is 
  feeding us with lies<br />
Locked down<br />
Lost control<br />
While the world we know is 
  coming to a fall</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Break the chain<br />
Stand up and fight<br />
Take away our freedom<br />
No they ain't got the right<br />
Shake awake, get up and unite<br />
Free your energy<br />
Look the enemy<br />
In the eye</p>

<p>Dark suits<br />
In the shade<br />
Bring solutions to 
  the problems they create</p>

<p>One world<br />
One design<br />
One religion<br />
to possess the global mind<br />
Stand tall<br />
Stand your ground<br />
While the world will only 
  try to tear you down</p>

<p class="em">Chorus</p>

<p>No world order!<br />
No world order!<br />
No world order!<br />
No world order!</p>

<p class="em">Chorus 2x</p>
