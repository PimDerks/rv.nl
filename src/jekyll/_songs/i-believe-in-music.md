<p>In this desperate time I don't belong<br />
But my dream lives on, it's all I ever know<br />
The ground I built upon is dead and gone<br />
Though my will is strong,<br />
I'm lost without a home</p>

<p>All the anarchy kills the melody<br />
But no matter what it takes<br />
I will come through</p>

<p>I believe in music, I believe in love<br />
I believe in all its magic, magic<br />
I believe in music, I believe in love<br />
I believe we'll overcome</p>

<p>This uninspiring world where love is gon<br />e
Turns right into wrong in agony I roam<br />
Through these abandoned streets<br />
I sing my song<br />
Still dreaming on for better times to come</p>

<p>What is left for me in this misery<br />
Holding on is all that I can do</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>
