title: Save Our Souls
year: 2014-01-01
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: Being inspired by Jeff Buckley’s ‘Grace’, I came up with the verses. It’s about trying to escape from Bizarro World. That whatever you do, wherever you go, you would never fit in. It’s about time to escape, run away. Before it’s too late. But the question is, where to escape to?

<p>Flee in the night, fear for your life<br />
    I warned you, here you're nothing but a loser<br />
    Crossed and denied, blinded your sight<br />
    I told you, you shouldn't stare into the sun</p>

<p>And I try try try try<br />
    Got to find a remedy time is running out on me<br />
    Try try try try<br />
    Now that I'm hearing the sound of goodbye</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Save our souls<br />
    Run to the water, run to the sea<br />
    Across the ocean, against the stream</p>

<p>Dark is the night for a freak left behind<br />
    I warned you, you shouldn't play a game of losers<br />
    Misguided missile, it's nearly the end of the line<br />
    You're staring into the barrel of a gun</p>

<p>It's too high high high high<br />
    The hopes and fears, the fantasies,<br />
    the blasphemy, the ecstacy ecstasy<br />
    High high high high<br />
    Now that I'm hearing the sound of goodbye</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus)</p>

<p>Run for your life<br />
    Run to the border, try to break free<br />
    Before it's all over, get out of here</p>

<p class="em">(Repeat chorus)</p>
