title: The Mistake
year: 2014-01-01
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: The song is about the event where it started to go downhill in my personal life. The lyrics are clear enough, theyâ€™re literal. One of the favorite rock ballads I wrote. It was only a bonus track on Falling Down In Misanthropolis and I felt it needed to be exposed better.

<p>One more kiss before you go<br />
One more touch the way we used to know<br />
Just one last embrace, the gate's about to close...<br />
Is it over...?</p>

<p>One last glance before you're gone<br />
How did it come to this, it feels so wrong<br />
If I had only known the things that I know now...<br />
That I just can't live without you</p>

<p>It's our first mistake<br />
That we had to say goodbye, turn our lives into a lie<br />
It's my worst mistake...<br />
Being without you</p>

<p>One more drink to make me numb<br />
There's nothing left for me to carry on<br />
It's one great big charade that guides me through the years...<br />
Now it's over...</p>

<p>One last step before I go<br />
The bridge I built for us is about to blow...<br />
Just one final wish, the train is gonna come<br />
Guess I'm better off dead without you</p>

<p>It's our first mistake<br />
That we had to say goodbye, turn our lives into a lie<br />
It's my worst mistake...<br />
Without you</p>

<p>We learned the hard way, we were young and we were blind<br />
But I still<br /> wear your ring 'til the day I die</p>

<p class="em">(Solo)</p>

<p>Guess I'm better off dead without you</p>

<p>It's my worst mistake<br />
It turned my life into a lie, from the day we said goodbye<br />
It's my worst mistake<br />
Being far away from you, ripped my heart out, torn in two<br />
Life's a big mistake...<br />
Without you...</p>
