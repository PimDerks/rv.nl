<p>Once upon a time this world was so magistral<br />
Every generation had its heroes<br />
Carrying out what the Master is standing for</p>

<p>I lived in a world where music had a mission<br />
It filled our hearts with hope and brought a vision<br />
Oh it was grand, yes we know where we heading for</p>

<p>But then they called me up with news about my physical<br />
I was incurably ill, they told me 'bout the miracle<br />
We could freeze you until there is a cure</p>

<p>So my life was in the hands of science<br />
I asked my Friend above for help and guidance<br />
Nothing to fear cause I knew I was destined for</p>

<p>For years I waited in this preservation<br />
For the salvation, the revelation<br />
Apparently death till the genies had found a cure</p>

<p>And then they finally found what everyone was waiting for<br />
They woke me up, and I was fine, it was a miracle<br />
Then this lovely voice whispered in my ear, she said:</p>

<p>Welcome to the nineties<br />
Decade of emptiness<br />
Welcome to the nineties<br />
I wish you all the best<br />
Welcome to the place <br />
where hope is in disgrace - hey!<br />
Welcome to the time<br />
where right is wrong and wrong is right</p>

<p>Welcome to the nineties<br />
Decade of emptiness<br />
Welcome to the nineties<br />
I wish you all the best<br />
Welcome to the place <br />
where love is out of place - hey!<br />
Welcome to the time<br />
where right is wrong and wrong is right</p>

<p>(Chorus)</p>

<p>Welcome to the nineties<br />
Welcome to the nineties</p>
