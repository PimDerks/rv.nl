<p>I met her at a gig back in '93<br />
The most beautiful face I've ever seen<br />
Paris fueled our passion, it began</p>

<p>But faded fame forced her faith to fade<br />
When the tables are turned I finally learned<br />
Never take a bitch into the van</p>

<p>She said, I was a one hit wonder and I'm way too shy<br />
And I won't become a million-seller dead or alive<br />
Baby, don't set my soul aside</p>

<p>Baby, I'm dying here tonight (over and over)<br />
Baby, I'm dying deep inside<br />
(Coming to America)<br />
I thought I was all you had<br />
The prize your heart has won<br />
But all that she could say, it was just for fun</p>

<p>Change of signs caused a change of tide<br />
And in no time I was back in sight<br />
It didn't take that long till she returned</p>

<p>Long live love in a lonely life<br />
The lady leech wants to be my wife<br />
She wants to suck up everything I've earned</p>

<p>We planned a pure white wedding<br />
With Wayne and Garth<br />
Rain or shine till death do us part<br />
Look how she's walking down the aisle</p>

<p>Baby I'm lying deep inside (over and over)<br />
Baby I'll pay you back tonight<br />
(Coming to America)<br />
Do I take this woman as my lawfully wedded wife<br />
No, I'm here to say, it was just for fun</p>

<p>All I'm searching for<br />
Is what your heart can't be<br />
Genuine love and honesty</p>

<p>Baby, your dying here tonight (over and over)<br />
Baby, I'm dying deep inside<br />
(Coming to America)<br />
I thought I was all you had<br />
The prize your heart has won<br />
But all that you could say,<br />
All that I could say<br />
All that we could say, it was just for fun</p>
