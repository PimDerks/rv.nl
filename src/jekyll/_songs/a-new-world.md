composer: Robby Valentine
about: | 
  This was the first song I recorded for TMBP. Itâ€™s about hate towards how it generally works in life. That people lose their identity and become slaves to the system , and the need to belong. A melodic heavy guitar mid-tempo song. A pop metal-track. With my good old choir-friend Johan Willems joining me in the harmonies.
