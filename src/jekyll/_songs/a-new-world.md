about: | 
  This was the first song I recorded for TMBP. Itâ€™s about hate towards how it generally works in life. That people lose their identity and become slaves to the system , and the need to belong. A melodic heavy guitar mid-tempo song. A pop metal-track. With my good old choir-friend Johan Willems joining me in the harmonies.

<p>I want a new world<br />
Can't take this no more<br />
I hate this world<br />
It's fake to the core<br />
Don't wanna live this lie no more</p>

<p>I wanna be true<br />
But there just ain't no place<br />
For a thing that's true<br />
In the money-making rat race<br />
I need a new horizon now</p>

<p>There ain't no gold at the end of each rainbow<br />
Nothing but stories and lies</p>

<p>Don't want a new car - I want a new life<br />
I want a new system - I want to be right<br />
I wanna have something worthwhile dying for<br />
Something real worth fighting for<br />
Tonight - I'm gonna make this right</p>

<p>I want a new world<br />
Gotta break down these walls<br />
A brand new world<br />
With justice for all<br />
I just don't take this crap no more</p>

<p>Would you believe half the world's in denial<br />
Nothing but stories and lies</p>

<p>Don't want a new car - I want a new life<br />
I want a new system - I want to be right<br />
I wanna have something worthwhile dying for<br />
Something real worth fighting for<br />
Tonight - I'm gonna make this right</p>

<p>Would you believe half the world's in denial<br />
Nothing but stories and lies</p>

<p>Don't want a new car - I want a new life<br />
I want a new system - I want to be right<br />
I wanna have something worthwhile dying for<br />
Something real worth fighting for<br />
Tonight - I'm gonna make this right</p>
