<p>This AVI takes an age to download on the Internet (and I don't have a Real Player)<br />
With just one hand to please me on the Internet (I meant the mouse - squeek!)<br />
Come on in, or CUM on in on the Internet</p>

<p>H-T-T-P We we we are the V-site dot com<br />
H-T-T-P She she she's just a pic - but I come...</p>
