title: Just A Dream (Someone Sold The World)
year: 2006
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: |
  Musically the most easy going song of this CD. A bit Sgt. Pepper Beatle-minded. Lovely harmonies and chord progressing. An authentic composition brought into the new era.

  Still lost in the maze of a heartbreak wanting to escape that miserable state of mind. Everything has changed just by following a dream that turned out wrong. Burned bridges, no return to whatâ€™s used to be, lost in an alternate world with no way out.
