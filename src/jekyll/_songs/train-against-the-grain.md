<p>I'm not allowed to be sad<br />
Cause my dad's been dad for some time now<br />
See how they forgot along the way<br />
No I did not die, committed suicide<br />
I took the vow<br />
Precious little selfish seems O.K.</p>

<p>That's what friends are for these times<br />
Not worth a dollar nor a dime</p>

<p>I take a train against the grain<br />
and let the whole world go insane<br />
I let it go I say FO<br />
To all you maggots down below</p>

<p>She didn't cry so much<br />
She seemed not so touched<br />
She is all right<br />
She'll resume the thread along the way<br />
So you got no time<br />
You're so caught up in your own life<br />
I just can't help by feeling so betrayed.</p>
