<p>We started counting since the day He was born<br />
But still people are doubting for He was the Holy Son</p>

<p>He sent an angel to the heart of this man<br />
And gave Him a mission to spread the world about the promised land</p>

<p>Calling out a message for all<br />
Coming to this cesspool to save our souls</p>

<p>Make way for the messenger<br />
Make way for the messenger<br />
Make way for the truth inside<br />
The good inside your heart<br />
Make way for the messenger<br />
Make way</p>

<p>Love and religion are going down nowhere days<br />
Lust and suspicion reveals itself in oh so many ways</p>

<p>He tells us to believe in our souls (pray for redemption for all)<br />
And fight the demons before they take control</p>

<p>Make way for the messenger<br />
Make way for the messenger<br />
Make way for the truth inside<br />
The good inside your heart<br />
Make way for the messenger<br />
Make way</p>

<p>I want it, I want it now<br />
Make way, make way!</p>
