Inspired by some ‘New Romantic’ bands from the mid 80’s and David Bowie from that era.
First time I sang lower than I usually do. I tried to get a bit of an 80’s sound in the production.
Again some things are taken from the demo I couldn’t get better : the Lead vocal and guitar solo.
Most of the drums is a drum machine programmed. Recorded this song 3 times. Twice with real drums, but in the end it asked for a tighter, more mechanical approach.
