<p>Tempted by faithless disguise<br />
Shadows and lies, taking my eyes to nowhere<br />
Nothing left but hate and despite<br />
No shimmering light<br />
Just like it died forever more</p>

<p>Father see what they have done to me<br />
They broke my stairway to the stars<br />
Like there is no tomorrow<br />
Darkness fills my heart<br />
Please would you carry me throughout my tears<br />
My biggest fear's that you're leaving me</p>

<p>Father tell me what went wrong with me<br />
How I can reach the highest star<br />
I need a new tomorrow, magic in my heart<br />
Please would you carry me to better years<br />
All through my fears you're saving me</p>

<p>And now forever and a day<br />
I will never lose my way<br />
I'll be there, this time I swear<br />
Forever more, forever more</p>

<p>'Cause now forever and a day<br />
To your wish I will obey<br />
I'll be there, this time I swear<br />
Forever more, forever more, forever more</p>

<p>I don't wanna live this life<br />
When the good is in the past<br />
I don't wanna envy<br />
All the memories that I have<br />
I don't wanna be denied<br />
Don't want to make no compromise<br />
This way I'd rather be dead</p>

<p>I will get my earthly paradise<br />
Make an end to life between the lies<br />
The mountain and the sea<br />
The love that's meant to be</p>

<p>No more sorrow, no more tears<br />
The end of all those painful years<br />
Now she is on my side, my everything, my life</p>

<p>No more sorrow, no more tears<br />
The end of all those painful years<br />
I love you, I love you, always and forever<br />
Forever more</p>

<p>And now forever and a day<br />
I will never lose my way<br />
I'll be there, this time I swear<br />
Forever more, forever more</p>

<p>But now forever and a day<br />
To your wish I will obey<br />
I'll be there, this time I swear<br />
Forever more, forever more<br />
Forever more, forever more</p>
