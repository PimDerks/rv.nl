<p>Dreaming - I get by when I'm dreaming<br />
Feeling - all the memories I'm keeping</p>

<p>Most of my wishes have seen the light<br />
But I'm still not done<br />
Somehow I don't see the stars at night<br />
Like the magic is gone</p>

<p>Down in the middle of a broken dream<br />
I'm changing inside<br />
Where's the key to my world<br />
Wish I was living up my memories<br />
There are no goodbyes - nothing at all</p>

<p>Feeling - life has changed every meaning<br />
Seeking - for some love to believe in</p>

<p>I long for the time when I had my dreams<br />
When I was young<br />
I lived by the spirit of fantasies<br />
But now the magic is gone</p>
