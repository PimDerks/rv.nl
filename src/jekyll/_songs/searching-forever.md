year: 2006-01-01
writer: Robby Valentine
composer: Robby Valentine
about: "1990 written piano ballad Searching Forever is about the end of a love .
Heartbroken and desolated, trying to face the thought that real love might not exist.
A beautiful but sad conclusion of the mainly dark atmosphere on the album."
