<p>Captain Eagle, can you make the clock to stop?<br />
Captain Eagle, I don't need the walls to talk<br />
Now what would you do when the joke's on you<br />
When they take you for a fool, gonna blow my kazoo</p>

<p>Captain Eagle, guess my life is on the rocks<br />
Captain Eagle, it's hard to breathe within the fog<br />
No, what you gonna do when the joke's on you<br />
Gonna get in my cocoon till the end of June</p>

<p>Baby don't cry<br />
The well didn't turn dry, blackberry pie<br />
Give me a smile<br />
Look at the sky<br />
See how they fly</p>

<p>Captain Eagle<br />
Captain Eagle, I am living in a rock<br />
Now what I'm gonna do when I can't get through<br />
Gonna step in my ballon and sail to the moon</p>

<p>Chorus</p>

<p>Don't you see we never get up before noon<br />
This way we grow old way too soon<br />
Yeah yeah<br />
Yeah yeah yeah</p>

<p>Chorus x 2</p>

<p>Captain Eagle, can you make the clock to stop?</p>
