<p>Destiny was calling from the sky (I'm falling, I'm falling)<br />
Showed me what a fool I've been to waste my life (and told me to retrieve)<br />
Nothing that I want is so impossible<br />
Everything I'm looking for is closer than it seems<br />
but it's invisible, magical, find it all before it's too late</p>

<p>Memories did get into my mind (remember, remember)<br />
Gave me sparks of hope, enough to make a fire (time to disretreat)<br />
All the time I waited for a miracle<br />
But none will ever happen for the passive and the numb<br />
who never hear the call, climb that wall, standing tall, before it's too late</p>

<p>The city lights will take me home tonight<br />
Through the satellite I open up my eyes<br />
The city lights will take me home tonight<br />
But Valeria's eyes shine away the light</p>

<p>Destiny was calling from the sky (I'm falling, I'm falling)<br />
Told me what fool I've been to waste my life (and told me to retrieve)<br />
Even when you're looking for a miracle<br />
Never stop believing, perserverance is the key to find it all</p>

<p>The city lights will take me home tonight<br />
Through the satellite I open up my eyes<br />
The city lights will take me home tonight<br />
But Valeria's eyes shine away the light</p>

<p>Nothing isn't quite the way it seems<br />
Feeling it's the most impossible dream I'm on</p>

<p>The city lights will take me home tonight<br />
Through the satellite I open up my eyes<br />
The city lights will take me home tonight<br />
But Valeria's eyes shine away the light<br />
The city lights will take me home tonight<br />
And Valeria dies in my dream tonight</p>
