Not a thing can turn you on
Out of reach you're a mastodon
Misfortune treats you like no other
Where are the goals you've set in mind
It's a farce for the color blind
No one can see it so why bother

It's all about love - love - it's all about love
It's all about love - love

It's all about dope - and a Rolex on the wrist
of your hand on the wheel of a Benz
It's all about sex it's the mainspring -
it's the thing that makes the world go round
Not the sound of the birds, not the waterfall,
sunset, rainbow, stop this train 
I wanna get off, I've had enough
don't you know that I gotta let go, let go, let go

So you wanted to be free from this life
And you're so determined to make it real this time
So you want to make it end
Let me tell you my friend
You should be glad you're alive

Why would I be so intoxicated by lonely eyes
Why don't I see without masquerade
And smile at the world
Oh why oh why oh why
