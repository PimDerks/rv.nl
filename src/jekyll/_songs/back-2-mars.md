<p>Something inside me makes me so alone<br />
Is it just the way I act (oh yeah)<br />
This world denies me, sets me on my own<br />
To this sham I don't connect</p>

<p>On the stairs of life I felt a thousand times<br />
So don't tell me what I've learned<br />
Do I have to fight windmills all my life?<br />
Forever and ever?</p>

<p>I got to get back to Mars<br />
And leave this everlasting farce<br />
I know it's right cause it's always on my mind<br />
Please help me get to the light</p>

<p>A chain reaction's what I want to achieve<br />
Not some imbecile attack<br />
Magistral actions, for them it's too unreal<br />
What can I do when they're the crackerjacks</p>

<p>The umteempth test of time showed me once again<br />
That I can't take it anymore<br />
Do I have to fight windmills all my life?<br />
Forever and ever?</p>
