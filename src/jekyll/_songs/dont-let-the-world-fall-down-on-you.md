<p>Why do I believe in love<br />
Why do I believe<br />
Why did I deceive my trust<br />
Why did I deceive</p>

<p>Nothing really matters now my dreams have all been shattered<br />
Life is out of my hands<br />
It's all a stupid battle I can't take it anymore<br />
Can't you hear me calling</p>

<p>Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
Even when you think you can't make it<br />
Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
'Cause he's coming back for you<br />
Give it everything you have<br />
We need you now<br />
You must do the best you can<br />
You'll win somehow<br />
Life ain't just another lie</p>

<p>Nothing really matters now my soul is badly battered<br />
All my feelings are dead<br />
I can't carry on now the innocence is gone<br />
Can't you see me falling</p>

<p>Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
Even when you think you can't make it<br />
Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
'Cause he's coming back for you - darling<br />
Give it everything you have<br />
We need you now<br />
You must do the best you can<br />
You'll win somehow<br />
Sitting on the dancefloor</p>

<p>Solo</p>

<p>Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
Even when you think you can't make it<br />
Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
'Cause he's coming back for you - darling<br />
Give it everything you have<br />
We need you now<br />
You must do the best you can<br />
You'll win somehow</p>

<p>Solo</p>

<p>Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
Even when you think you can't make it<br />
Don't let the world fall down on you<br />
'Cause he's coming back for you<br />
Give it everything you have<br />
We need you now<br />
You must do the best you can<br />
You'll win somehow<br />
Life ain't just another lie</p>

<p>Why</p>
