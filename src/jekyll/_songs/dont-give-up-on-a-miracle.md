<p>Don't stop keeping your dreams alive<br />
No you can't give up on a miracle<br />
Come start leave all your fears behind<br />
No we ain't got time for the cynical<br />
don't give up on a miracle<br />
aaaah</p>

<p>Big Chuck had a pick-up truck<br />
A guitar and long black hair<br />
No luck with the picking up<br />
'Cause the girls in town didn't care</p>

<p>He had a pig farm<br />
a crazy family<br />
A wicked dog who'd kill and attack<br />
He was a rockstar In his fantasy<br />
Wanted to leave and never come back</p>

<p class="em">Chorus:</p>

<p>Don't stop keeping your dreams alive<br />
No you can't give up on a miracle<br />
Come start leave all your fears behind<br />
No we ain't got time for the cynical<br />
don't give up on a miracle<br />
aaaah</p>

<p>Chuck's stuck, feeling all fucked up<br />
His life sucked<br />
But nobody cared<br />
He made plans<br />
Gonna take a chance<br />
to get the hell out of there</p>

<p>He sold the pig farm<br />
Ditched the family<br />
And used the cash on studio time<br />
He blew them socks off<br />
Got a record-deal<br />
Went on the road<br />
and never came back</p>

<p class="em">Chorus 4x</p>
