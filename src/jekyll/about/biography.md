<h2 class="section-title">Biography</h2>

<p class="lead">Robby Valentine was born in the Netherlands in 1968 and began with classical piano lessons at the age of six. Initially his taste ran more to Beethoven, Chopin and Mozart, but a revelation occurred when he saw the video of Queen's "Bohemian Rhapsody" in 1975. The fusion of heavy rock and various classical themes combined with Freddie Mercury's great voice, Brian May's amazing guitar licks, Roger Taylor's rhythmic drumming and John Deacon's solid bass playing changed his musical views forever. His daily piano practice became filled with learning the complete repertoire of Queen and other bands. From picking out tunes on the piano he soon graduated to making his own variations. The next logical move was to start writing his own songs and step by step Robby Valentine the composer was born.</p>

<p>Robby's parents were quick to recognize their son's talent and to stimulate him ever further, his father rebuilt the back garden shed into a sound-proof professional studio where Robby could compose without waking up the neighbors. In the years that followed Robby spent all of his free time writing songs and studying the piano and keyboards.</p>

<h3>From T-Vistix to Zinatra</h3>
<p>Robby joined his first band at the age of fourteen: the local T-Vistix. They played all sorts of styles, from reggae to ordinary pop songs. A half year later Robby joined the local symphonic rock band The Spoiled Brats. But Robby was not satisfied with touring the local club scene and went looking for another band. Via an ad in the newspaper he joined the symphonic rock band Line from Rotterdam. Line gained some attention by releasing a single: "Solitary Nite/ Seasons", written by Robby. The single was played several times on the radio but never had any chart success. Due to lack of success, Robby decided to quit Line and to startup a band himself. The Result was First Avenue, who became one of the most promising bombastic rock bands from the Netherlands. But unfortunately they never made it big time. After First Avenue, Robby joined Zinatra, a reasonably popular Happy-Metal band. They released an album," The Great Escape" and three singles. One of those," Love Never Dies" is the first release to feature Robby on lead-vocals, singing a duet with Zinatra's singer Joss Mennen.</p>

<h3>Going solo</h3>

<p>Then finally his dream came true: Polydor <a href="#">offered him a contract</a> to produce a solo album, and a year later, in 1991, the first Robby Valentine single," Over And Over Again" was released. The single was a huge success in the Netherlands, giving Robby his first and up till now last top five hit. In February 1992 Robby released his first album, simply entitled Robby Valentine. After two more hits, Robby decided to tour the Netherlands. He recruited some of the top Dutch musicians to form a band. It consisted of: Rob Winter: guitars, Arthur Polini: bass guitar, John Ewbank: keyboards and Hans Eykenaar: drums. Robby himself played some guitar, keyboards and sang.</p>

<h3>The Magic Infinity</h3>

<p>In 1993 Robby released his second album, The Magic Infinity. Although less successful than his first album, there was some chart success for two songs: No Turning Back and Megaman. The last song was converted to a jingle for the popular Dutch TV channel Veronica. In the spring of 1993 Robby met Brian May backstage at a Dutch television show. Brian, who already knew Robby's brilliant "Valentine's Overture", was very impressed by Robby's musical abilities and he asked Robby to be his support act on the second half of the Brian May Band tour. Another dream seemed to come true for Robby, but a serious problem arose: Robby's drummer, Hans Eykenaar had already been booked by his other band, Candy Dulfer and the Funky Stuff. Robby's only chance was Juan van Emmerloot, A drummer that Robby met earlier that year when they both contributed to Valensia's album "Valensia". Fortunately Juan, who also is drummer with Snowy White, was free and four days before the tour started they started rehearsing. During the tour, Robby Valentine played for audiences consisting of 5.000 - 15.000 people in France and Germany and they were received rather good by the audiences.</p>

<p>At about the same time Polydor released an album in Germany and some other countries, a compilation of the first two albums, called "No Turning Back". In 1994 Japan discovered Robby Valentine. People were paying enormous amounts of money to have the two albums imported so Polydor decided to release the albums with some extra bonus tracks in Japan. The albums sold very good and without ever visiting the country, Robby became a star in Japan. After that Robby Valentine's name was changed into Valentine, because American band Valentine had split up and Valentine had always been the name Robby and his band wanted to have. His next project was a single to be released in Japan only, to support the people who had suffered from the earthquake in Kobe, "Hand In Hand". The single was a big success, climbing the charts until it couldn't climb no more...And Valentine's first number one was a fact!</p>

<h3>Third album and a new band</h3>
<p>In 1995 Robby worked hard on a new album which was released in Japan at the end of 1995 and in the Netherlands early 1996. The title:" Valentine". Robby was having musical and financial differences with his band members and decided to form a new band, consisting of: Vinnie Kay: guitars, Bert Dijkema: Bass guitar, Giovanni Pileri: Keyboards and Juan van Emmerloot: Drums. The old band members continued their careers in the backing band of famous Dutch singer Marco Borsato. In Japan, Valentine's new single "Where Do We Go From Here" also hit the number one spot. In march and April Valentine toured the Netherlands and even Japan, where they were received as megastars.</p>

<h3>Continued success in Japan</h3>
<p>After that the 'United' album was recorded and released (1997), also a success in Japan. This was the first album that hasn't been released in The Netherlands, because Robby's Dutch Deal with Polydor came to an end.</p>

<p>In 1998 the 'No Sugar Added' album was released, which features some new songs, but also some old songs Valentine had written for other bands, a b-side and a solo song Valentine had written in 1992.</p>

<h2 class="section-title">Robby talks</h2>

<p>Let me take you back to the beginning, how I started to develop my love for music. We had an old upright-piano at home and when I was still busy with my toys and blocks my mother was often playing it. I mostly remember Chopin waltzes and Mozart sonates, which I would hum along to. (so she told me) The piano and a small accordion became favourite toys. When I was 6 I finally was allowed to get real piano-lessons and only a few months later the absolute k.o. was already there on the silver screen. A revelation to me. Late 1975. There he was: Freddie Mercury. Bohemian Rhapsody. Queen! From that day on I knew what I wanted to do with my life: Become a Rock Artist. Not only the sound touched me to the core, the visual aspect was as much as important. It was crystal clear to me, this was my calling. And nothing else would matter.</p>

<p>I kept that faith, didn’t even finish high school. So no back-up plan. Fortunately my parents were on my side, supporting me with everything. The best I could ever wish for. Besides Queen there were The Babys who stole my heart, with my other big hero: singer John Waite, Electric Light Orchestra and The Beatles. Those were my biggest influences when I grew up. A few years later I started to play some guitar, but had to admit I was better on the keys. Joined my first ‘real’ band when I was 14, T. Vistix. A ska-reggae pop band. They were the ones to corrupt me with the eye liner. It was 1983, it was allowed, even fashionable for guys in a band. There was my excuse, super-shy as I was I followed their example. And it got a little out of hand in the future.</p>

<p>Back to music. One year later we broke up and I joined the rock-band Spoiled Brats which I was a fan of. At that time I started to develop the song writing. And I got the chance to sing a few songs and overcame my shyness in that. With my next melodic-rock band Line we had some modest national success. We reached the finals of the National band contest "The Great Prize Of The Netherlands" and we had a lot of airplay with our single ‘Solitary Nite’. Even appeared on the legendary Dutch pop program ‘TOPPOP’. I left Line to form a new melodic-rock group called 1 st Avenue. Did a lot of gigs in Holland from 1987 until 1989. Well on our way I grew a big frustration as just being the ‘posing’ and jumping idiot behind the rack of keyboards. But because of bronchitis, hay fever I thought I had to forget about my dream to become also a lead singer. But the hunger for that just was unbearably huge and I realized I had no choice to do all I could to overcome that handicap as much as possible.
So during the recordings of 1st Avenue’s debut album I left the band to start a solo-career. It took 6 months of demo-ing until I signed to Polydor. In the meantime of writing and recording more songs for my solo debut I became a temporary member of Zinatra. Recorded the album ‘The Great Escape’ with them. Did some radio and TV and a toured Holland from late`89 untill early`91.</p>

<p>Fall 1990: The recording of ‘Robby Valentine’ with producer/engineer Erwin Musper in the famous Wisseloord studios. It took 2 years from signing the deal until the release. In the mean time I met my current manager Willem de Bois who ‘heard’ a hit single in the piano ballad ‘Over and Over Again’ which I planned for a b-side. He advised me to turn it into a Rock-Ballad. So I did make a demo and the ball started to roll. They asked my favourite American producer/engineer Humberto Gattica to do the song and he accepted. Recorded in Holland with engineer Attie Bauw (who later that year did 2 nd single Love "Takes Me higher" with me) and mixed in Los Angeles (studio Ground Control). It was released as my first single in the autumn of 1991 and became a hit in the Netherlands and several Asian countries.</p>
<p>Formed a great live-band to tour Holland in the first half of 1992:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Arthur Polini (Bass)</li>
    <li>Rob Winter (Guitars)</li>
    <li>Hans Eijkenaar (Drums)</li>
    <li>John Ewbank (Keyboards)</li>
    <li>Robby Valentine (Vocals/Piano/Guitar)</li>
</ul>

<p>We also did lots of radio and TV shows. We rehearsed a lot on the harmony-vocals, since it was such a big aspect in my music. On the recordings I layered my own voice endlessly together with my friend Johan Willems. But that was of course impossible to reproduce on stage. However in those days it was against the law to play with back-up tapes for live. And I didn’t want to have a backing-vocal group on stage. That would take the whole ‘rock & roll’ band feeling down to a family affair. So each band member had to be able to sing as well. And not to mention accepting me terrorizing them. They took great pride in it and did a fantastic job. We were ace. Those were the days.</p>

<p>In 1993 we recorded the 2 nd album "The Magic Infinity" with Pim Koopman and John Sonneveld, again in Wisseloord. We were offered to do the German leg of the 1993 Brian May – Back To The Light tour. That was our absolute dream come true. But the problem was, we didn’t have a drummer. 4 days before the first show we found Juan van Emmerloot. He turned out to be the perfect drummer for my music, and saved the day. Also with the extra help of Johan for backing-vocals, the Valentine-band sounded better than ever and that tour became one of the highlights of my musical-life. However unfortunately soon after that we grew apart, except for new drummer Juan, and I recorded most of the following record by myself again. During that time, 1994, Polydor Japan released my first 2 albums. Invited me for a fantastic promotion tour. We still played some nice gigs in Holland and Belgium including a huge outdoor event "Mega Music Rock Experience" with headliner Aerosmith.</p>

<p>But one year later after finishing the 3 rd album ‘Valentine’ (1995) the band disbanded. A few tracks on that album were recorded and mixed by John Tilly and some others mixed by British engineer Matt Butler, both at Wisseloord. I was offered to come back to Japan for live-concerts. So had to form a new live band. The new line-up became:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Vinnie Kay (Guitars)</li>
 <li>Bert Dijkema (Bass)</li>
 <li>Giovanni Pileri (Keyboards)</li>
 <li>Juan van Emmerloot (Drums)</li>
 <li>Robby Valentine (Vocals/Piano/Guitar)</li>
 </ul>
 <p>After 2 months of intensive rehearsals, some try out gigs in Holland, we went to Japan. (Spring 1996) It was the best musical experience so far, performing for this fantastic Japanese audience. The band was real tight and they also did a great job on the harmony vocals.</p>

<p>Back home I started to write and record the 4 th album ‘United’, and returned to Osaka-Japan to write most of the songs. Most of it was mixed by Matt Butler, at the Wisseloord studios. It came out in Japan, June 1997. Went back for promotion. But times had changed drastically. My dad passed away.</p>

<p>End of 1997 Japan released mini x-mas album ‘Christmas In Heaven’. 1998, No Sugar Added. I had a hard time getting myself inspired enough to write a complete new album so I re-recorded a few songs from the past.</p>

<p>Fall 1998 I teamed up with Valensia Clarkson to start ‘V. We signed a 3 album contract with Universal Japan and the first saw the light of day in the summer of 1999. Recorded with Juan van Emmerloot and David Clarkson, Valensia’s brother, on drums. Mixed and recorded by Holger Schwedt at Wisseloord and Bullit Sound. Later that year we went to Japan for concerts. The line up:</p>
 <ul>
 <li>Juan van Emmerloot (Drums)</li>
 <li>Patrick Buys (Bass)</li>
 <li>Valensia (Vocals/Guitar)</li>
 <li>Robby Valentine (Vocals/Piano/Guitar)</li>
 </ul>


<p>In 2000 I made the "Believing Is Seeing" album. Recorded the basics ‘live’ in the studio, with again Juan on drums, at Fendal Soundstudio’s by Hans van Vondelen. He also mixed the album. It was released in November from that year. In 2001 I recorded my half of the 2 nd V-album. Released summer 2002.</p>

<p>From the Autumn of 2002 till Autumn 2003 I made the "The Most Beautiful Pain". Right after that I started a side-project named Kyssmet. For this I wanted to find a female vocalist instead of singing the lead myself. Through my friend Peter Strykes I found Filipina singer Alyss Andico. She was the perfect singer, everything I hoped for to find for the project. We recorded the Kyssmet album in 2004.</p>

<p>Also at that time I teamed up again with Valensia to do the 3 rd V album: NYMPHOPSYCHOSCHIZOPHONIC. End of 2004 I recorded another solo album with the working title: "Who Killed Robby Valentine ?" But just lately I realized I’m not dead yet after all. I hope to have some information very soon according the release of the albums to begin with the long awaited "The Most Beautiful Pain".</p>
