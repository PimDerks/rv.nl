    		<p class="u-lead">Dear friends,<br >

I'm currently rounding off the recording of my new album - THE ALLIANCE - it is now YOUR chance to support the album by purchasing one of the sponsorship or pre-sale packages.</p>

<p>If you have any other ideas for sponsorship or have any questions about the packages don't hesitate and contact us through <a href="mailto:robbyvalentinepromo@gmail.com">robbyvalentinepromo@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p>The release party will be held in P3 Purmerend on the 16th of June 2018. If you are not interested in one of the packages you can ofcourse also just order the album for 20 EUR incl. shipping.</p>

<p>I'm looking forward to seeing you all at the release party, and I hope that you like the new album!</p>

<p>Sincerely, <br /><img src="/images/autograph.png" /></p>

							<p>All packages (apart from package A) give you the chance to purchase eternal fame and have your name listed in the booklet of the new album for an additional  €50,-. If you want to sponsor the album, please select that option in the pre-order form!</p>

						<div class="box a-inner a-inner+">

							<p>All extra items being sold in the sponsorship and pre-sale packages are limited edition. If however we do not sell all items made, the 'left overs' will be sold at the merchandise stand at the release party & our other shows. So you don't necessarily have to purchase an expensive sponsor package. 
							You can also take your chances and hope not everything will be sold out during the pre-sale and save some money while you're at it.</p>

							<p>All content on this page and in the packages is subject to change. If for example not enough packages are sold to warrant the production of a deluxe edition this perk might be cancelled. If that is the case you will ofcourse receive a refund for the changed item based on the prices below.</p>
							 
							<p>Prices will be as follows after June 16 (shipment not included):</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The new album: €15,-</li>
								<li>Deluxe version of the album: € 35,-</li>
								<li>Bizarro World piano album: € 10,-</li>
								<li>Magic Infinity Demo's: € 25,-</li>
								<li>New T shirt: € 25,-</li>
								<li>Valentine Pendant: € 39,95</li>

						<h2>Shipping/postage</h2>
						<div class="box a-inner a-inner+">
							<p>All packages except A include early shipping of the main album (or the deluxe edition). This means that the album will be shipped one week in advance of the release-party, so you can sing along to all the songs! All other items can be picked up at the release-show.</p>

							<p>If you order one of the above packages and are NOT coming to the release party, we will first use the worth of your entrance ticket (EUR 15,-) for your shipment. If EUR 15,- turns out not to be enough to cover the shipment costs, you would have to pay an additional fee to cover extra costs for shipment.</p>

							<p>However, as we do not know the weight of the new products, we can't yet tell you how much postage will be yet. For the deluxe edition it will be a secured shipment, so in case your package gets lost you will receive a new one.</p>
