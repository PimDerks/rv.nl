Flashback to November 1975! I was only six years old, when lightning struck me, in the form of Bohemian Rhapsody, radiating from our television. I was just allowed to start taking piano-lessons, but it was not until after that first glimpse of Freddie Mercury that I knew why; everything that I had seen and heard was everything I wanted to become.

In December that same year, my grandmother gave me ‘A Night at the Opera’ for my seventh birthday. I practiced all the songs on the piano, became a member of the fanclub, collected anything about the band that I could get my hands on and also went to all their concerts when they played in the Netherlands. I remember saying to myself when I was a kid: ‘Freddie Mercury’s voice and the music of Queen is the most beautiful thing that will ever be heard on this planet!’ I still feel the same until this day.

For years, I resisted the temptation to cover Queen’s songs as it felt like blasphemy. Perhaps I was just afraid it would ruin the magic; afraid of the amount of work; afraid of the answer to the question: why? Nobody on earth could ever do it better than Queen. What kind of an idiot would try to copy the Mona Lisa?

In 2011 I was idiot enough. That resulted in ‘A Tribute To’ Queen, followed by ‘A Tribute To Queen 2’ in 2012.

Fast forward to 2014; now in your hands: ‘The Queen Album’! I wanted to combine the first two tribute albums, add five new songs, and create this ultimate 80-minute tribute album. Apart from ‘Under Pressure’ all songs are from the 1970’s, my favorite Queen era. I tried to stay as close to the original as I possibly could, while at the same time adding my personal touch.

Meticulously working out the arrangements, recording the instruments, and singing all the vocal lines gave me lots of headaches and frustration; but most of all it brought me satisfaction and pleasure; and new magical moments that I had never discovered before as a passive Queen listener. My admiration and adoration for Queen has grown even stronger. The magic is not ruined… It’s bigger than ever!

Freddie, Brian, Roger and John…. Thank you! For everything.
