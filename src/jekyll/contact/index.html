                            <h2>Press and bookings</h2>
                            <p>For interviews and other press-related information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:">info@robbyvalentine.nl</a>. We are happy to provide an electronic press kit with bio, pictures and music.</p>
                            <p>For bookings, please contact our booking-agent at <a href="mailto:">bookings@robbyvalentine.nl</a>. There are multiple options available, from solo/duo performances to full band shows.</p>

                            <h2>Merchandise</h2>
                            <p>We hope to have a "Shop"-page added to the website in 2017. For now, please e-mail us at <a href="mailto:valentinerobby@gmail.com">valentinerobby@gmail.com</a> if you'd like to purchase CD's, vinyl, shirts or other merchandise. Some pictures can be found at the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/robbyvalentine/photos/?tab=album&album_id=443764585829829">Robby Valentine Facebook-page</a>.</p>
                            <p>Please note that most merchandising orders are fullfilled by a very small team, so you may not receive an instant reply to your questions. For now we can only accept payment by bank-transfer or via PayPal.</p>
